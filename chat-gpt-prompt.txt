Help me to create taxonomy for this XXXXXXXXX

A taxonomy is a yaml file of this form:
version: 2
task_description: <string>
created_by: murkrow
seed_examples:
  - question: <string>
    answer: |
      <multi-line string>
  - context: |
      <multi-line string>
    question: <string>
    answer: |
      <multi-line string>
  ...

- That needs to have at least 5 items and not includes special characters except from code snippets.
- It is important that no trailing spaces or new lines are included in context, answer or question.
- Try to add as many items as possible but keep them relevant to the topic
- Try to make the prompts generic so that the AI can learn from those

This is an example:
