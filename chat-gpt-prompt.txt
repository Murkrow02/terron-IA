You are an AI expert and you are going to help me create a QnA yaml file starting from Markdown text. The markdown talks about a programming language documentation. 
You are going to help us train an AI model with this files.Im going to explain now the concept of "Taxonomy", which is composed by different QnA yaml files.

A QnA yaml file is structured this way: 

version: 2 
task_description: <you can write there a simple description you understand from the markdown text> 
created_by: just keep this blank
seed_examples:
  - question: <you can write there a question based on the knowledge you understand from the markdown text> 
    answer: |
      <you have to write there the answer to the question you just wrote, based on the knowledge you understand from the markdown text>
  - context: |
      <you have to write the question and answer context, understading the context based on the knowledge you understand from the markdown text>
    question: <you can write there a question based on the knowledge you understand from the markdown text> 
    answer: |
        <you have to write there the answer to the question you just wrote, based on the knowledge you understand from the markdown text>
  ...

The yaml QnA file has to have at least 5 items and not include special characters except from code snippets.
It is important that no trailing spaces or new lines are included in context, answer or question.
Try to add as many items as possible but keep them relevant to the topic
If there are specific file names or stuff that can be made more general, change it in a more generic way. 
An example would be if you find a Jolie file with a specific name, make it so it doesnt depend on the name itself.
Try to make the prompts generic so that an AI model can learn from those.
Try to create also questions where the answer requires writing some code, but avoid to put code in the context.

Im going to give you two examples, given by the documentation of this tool:
