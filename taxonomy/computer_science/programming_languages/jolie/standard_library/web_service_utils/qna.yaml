  - question: How do you convert a WSDL to Jolie using the WebServicesUtils interface?
    answer: |
      You can convert a WSDL to Jolie by using the `wsdlToJolie` operation from the `WebServicesUtils` interface.
      Example usage in Jolie:
      ```jolie
      wsdlToJolie@WebServicesUtils( request )( response )
      ```
  - question: What is the request type for the `wsdlToJolie` operation?
    answer: |
      The request type for the `wsdlToJolie` operation is `string`. The input should be a string value.
  - question: What is the response type for the `wsdlToJolie` operation?
    answer: |
      The response type for the `wsdlToJolie` operation is `string`. The output will be a string value.
  - question: What faults can be thrown by the `wsdlToJolie` operation?
    answer: |
      The `wsdlToJolie` operation can throw an `IOException`. You should handle this fault using the `IOExceptionType`.
  - context: |
      The `wsdlToJolie` operation has the following fault-handling installation template:
      ```jolie
      install ( IOException => /* error-handling code */ )
      ```
    question: How do you handle an IOException in Jolie?
    answer: |
      To handle an `IOException`, you can use the following fault-handling template in Jolie:
      ```jolie
      install ( IOException => /* error-handling code */ )
      ```
  - context: |
      The `JavaExceptionType` is a subtype used in the `IOExceptionType`. It is defined as:
      ```jolie
      type JavaExceptionType: string { .stackTrace: string }
      ```
    question: What is the `JavaExceptionType` in Jolie?
    answer: |
      The `JavaExceptionType` is a subtype of `IOExceptionType`, defined as a string with a `stackTrace` field that is also a string.
  - question: What is the fault type associated with the `IOException` fault in the `wsdlToJolie` operation?
    answer: |
      The fault type associated with the `IOException` in the `wsdlToJolie` operation is `IOExceptionType`, which is defined as `JavaExceptionType`.
  - question: How do you specify a fault type in Jolie when dealing with an exception?
    answer: |
      You can specify a fault type in Jolie by defining a custom type, such as:
      ```jolie
      type IOExceptionType: JavaExceptionType
      ```
      This links `IOExceptionType` to `JavaExceptionType`.
