  - question: How do you show a message dialog in SwingUI?
    answer: |
      To show a message dialog, use the `showMessageDialog` operation with a string request:
      ```jolie
      showMessageDialog@SwingUI("Your message here")(response)
      ```
      This operation doesn't return any value.
  - question: How do you invoke a yes/no question dialog in SwingUI?
    answer: |
      To invoke a yes/no question dialog, use the `showYesNoQuestionDialog` operation with a string request:
      ```jolie
      showYesNoQuestionDialog@SwingUI("Do you want to proceed?")(response)
      ```
      This operation returns an integer: 1 for 'Yes' and 0 for 'No'.
  - question: How do you request user input with SwingUI?
    answer: |
      To request user input, use the `showInputDialog` operation with a string request:
      ```jolie
      showInputDialog@SwingUI("Please enter your name:")(response)
      ```
      This operation returns the user input as a string.
  - context: |
      The SwingUI provides operations to interact with the user via dialog boxes. The `showMessageDialog` method shows a message, the `showYesNoQuestionDialog` asks the user a yes/no question, and the `showInputDialog` asks for user input.
    question: |
      What type of response does the `showYesNoQuestionDialog` return in SwingUI?
    answer: |
      The `showYesNoQuestionDialog` operation returns an integer, where 1 indicates 'Yes' and 0 indicates 'No'.
  - context: |
      SwingUI allows you to show dialogs for messages, yes/no questions, and user input. Each method requires a string request and returns either a string or an integer as a response.
    question: |
      What is the response type of `showMessageDialog` in SwingUI?
    answer: |
      The `showMessageDialog` operation has a response type of `void`, meaning it doesn't return any value.
  - question: How can I show a message dialog with the text "Hello, World!" using SwingUI in Jolie?
    answer: |
      You can show the message dialog with the following code:
      ```jolie
      showMessageDialog@SwingUI("Hello, World!")(response)
      ```
      This will display the message "Hello, World!" without returning any value.
  - question: How do you handle the response from the `showInputDialog` in SwingUI?
    answer: |
      To handle the response from `showInputDialog`, you can use the following code:
      ```jolie
      showInputDialog@SwingUI("Enter your name:")(response)
      // response will contain the string input by the user
      ```
      The response will be the string entered by the user.
