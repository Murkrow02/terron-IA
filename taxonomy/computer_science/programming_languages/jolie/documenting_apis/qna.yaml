  - question: What are forward documentation comments in Jolie?
    answer: |
      Forward documentation comments in Jolie are comments that document the syntactic node that follows them. They include:
      - `/** ... */`: multiline comment
      - `/// ...`: inline comment
  - question: What are backward documentation comments in Jolie?
    answer: |
      Backward documentation comments in Jolie are comments that document the syntactic node that precedes them. They include:
      - `/*< ... */`: multiline comment
      - `//< ...`: inline comment
  - question: How do you generate API documentation using joliedoc?
    answer: |
      To generate API documentation using joliedoc, run the command `joliedoc <filename>` where `<filename>` is the service file to document. Optionally, include the `--internals` flag to include all local input and output ports in the documentation.
  - context: |
      /** This type represents a message test type */
      type TestRRRequest: void {
          .field1: string //< this is field1
          .field2: double //< this is field2
      }
    question: How do you document fields in a Jolie type?
    answer: |
      Fields in a Jolie type can be documented using backward documentation comments. For example:
      `.field1: string //< this is field1`
  - context: |
      joliedoc test.ol
    question: What happens when you run the `joliedoc` command?
    answer: |
      Running the `joliedoc` command generates a folder named `joliedoc` containing a set of HTML files. These files can be navigated by opening `index.html` in a browser.
  - question: What does the `--internals` flag do in the joliedoc command?
    answer: |
      The `--internals` flag includes all local input and output ports in the generated documentation. By default, this is set to false.
  - question: How do you document operations in a Jolie interface?
    answer: |
      Operations in a Jolie interface are documented using forward documentation comments. For example:
      `/** this is a simple request-response operation */`
  - question: How do you specify the location and protocol for a port in Jolie?
    answer: |
      In Jolie, the location and protocol for a port are specified in the port declaration. For example:
      ```
      inputPort Service {
          Location: "socket://localhost:8000"
          Protocol: sodep
      }
      ```
