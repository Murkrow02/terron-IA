  - question: How can I read a JSON file in Jolie?
    answer: |
      You can use the `readFile@File` operation from the File library to read a JSON file in Jolie. Provide the file name and format as parameters to retrieve the file's content into a Jolie data structure.
  - context: |
      {
          "note": {
              "sender": "John",
              "receiver": "Jane",
              "content": "I made pasta"
          }
      }
    question: How do I access the 'receiver' field from the JSON file in Jolie?
    answer: |
        After reading the file into a variable, you can access the 'receiver' field using the standard Jolie syntax, like `data.note.receiver`.
  - question: How do you write data to a JSON file in Jolie?
    answer: |
      You can use the `writeFile@File` operation from the File library. Pass the target file name, format as "json," and the data structure to be written as the `content`.
  - context: |
      {
          "module": [
              {
                  "moduleId": "ONE",
                  "moduleName": "ONE",
                  "moduleOverview": "ONE"
              },
              {
                  "moduleId": "TWO",
                  "moduleName": "TWO",
                  "moduleOverview": "TWO"
              }
          ]
      }
    question: How can I add a new module to the JSON file using Jolie?
    answer: |
        Use `readFile@File` to load the current content of the JSON file into a variable, add the new module entry to the variable, and then use `writeFile@File` to save the updated structure back to the file.
  - question: What does the `embed File as File` line do in a Jolie program?
    answer: |
      The `embed File as File` line imports the File library into the Jolie service, allowing you to use its operations such as `readFile` and `writeFile`.
  - context: |
      writeFile@File( {
          filename = "note.json"
          format = "json"
          content << {
              note << {
                  sender = "John"
                  receiver = "Jane"
                  content = "I made pasta"
              }
          }
      } )()
    question: What format should be specified when writing a JSON file in Jolie?
    answer: |
        When writing a JSON file in Jolie, you should specify the format as "json" in the parameters of the `writeFile@File` operation.
  - question: Can you explain the role of `from file import File` in Jolie?
    answer: |
      The `from file import File` statement imports the File library in Jolie, which provides operations like `readFile` and `writeFile` for working with JSON and other file formats.
