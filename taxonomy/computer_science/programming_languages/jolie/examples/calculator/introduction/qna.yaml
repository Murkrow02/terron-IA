  - question: What is the first step in creating a calculator service in Jolie?
    answer: |
      The first step is defining an interface for the service, which includes listing the operations such as sum, sub, mul, and div.
  - context: |
      The following code defines an interface in Jolie for a calculator service that includes four operations: sum, sub, mul, and div.
      ```jolie
      interface CalculatorInterface {
          RequestResponse:
              sum,
              sub,
              mul,
              div
      }
      ```
    question: |
      What does the `interface CalculatorInterface` in Jolie define?
    answer: |
      It defines a service interface with four operations: sum, sub, mul, and div, each having a request-response type.
  - context: |
      The message types define the structure of the messages exchanged between the service and the clients. For example, the `SumRequest` type defines a vector of integers as the input for the sum operation.
      ```jolie
      type SumRequest: void {
          term[1,*]: int
      }
      ```
    question: |
      How do message types work in Jolie?
    answer: |
      Message types in Jolie define the structure of the messages exchanged in an operation. For example, `SumRequest` specifies a vector of integers as the input for the sum operation.
  - question: |
      How do you define the service behavior for the sum operation in Jolie?
    answer: |
      The behavior for the sum operation is defined by adding a block of code that loops through the terms in the request and adds them to the response.
  - context: |
      The service behavior for the sum operation is defined as follows:
      ```jolie
      [ sum( request )( response ) {
          for( t in request.term ) {
              response = response + t
          }
      }]
      ```
    question: |
      What does the code for the sum operation in Jolie do?
    answer: |
      It loops through the terms in the request and adds each term to the response, effectively calculating the sum.
  - question: |
      How do you define an input port for a Jolie service?
    answer: |
      An input port is defined with the `inputPort` keyword, specifying the location, protocol (such as HTTP), and the interface the service listens to.
  - context: |
      In Jolie, an input port for the calculator service can be defined like this:
      ```jolie
      inputPort CalculatorPort {
          location: "socket://localhost:8000"
          protocol: http { format = "json" }
          interfaces: CalculatorInterface
      }
      ```
    question: |
      What is the purpose of the `inputPort CalculatorPort` in the Jolie service definition?
    answer: |
      It defines the listening endpoint for the service, specifying the location, protocol (HTTP with JSON format), and the interface that the service exposes.
  - question: |
      How do you set up a service to perform basic arithmetic operations like sum, subtraction, multiplication, and division in Jolie?
    answer: |
      The service is set up by defining the operations within the `main` scope, where the specific behavior for each operation is coded to handle the request and produce a response.
  - context: |
      In the `main` scope, the operations for sum, sub, mul, and div are implemented as follows:
      ```jolie
      main {
          [ sum( request )( response ) {
              for( t in request.term ) {
                  response = response + t
              }
          }]
          [ sub( request )( response ) {
              response = request.minuend - request.subtraend
          }]
          [ mul( request )( response ) {
              response = 1
              for ( f in request.factor ) {
                  response = response * f
              }
          }]
          [ div( request )( response ) {
              response = request.dividend / request.divisor
          }]
      }
      ```
    question: |
      How is the `main` scope used to define operations in Jolie?
    answer: |
      The `main` scope is used to implement the behavior for each operation by specifying what happens when a request is received and how to compute the response for each operation.
