  - question: How do you add an input port with protocol SODEPS in Jolie?
    answer: |
      To add an input port with protocol SODEPS, you define the inputPort with the location and protocol. For example:
      ```jolie
      inputPort AdvancedCalculatorPortSODEPS {
          location: "socket://localhost:8006"
          protocol: sodeps {
              ssl.keyStore = "keystore.jks",
              ssl.keyStorePassword = "jolie!"
          }
          interfaces: AdvancedCalculatorInterface
      }
      ```
  - context: |
      In Jolie, the inputPort definition for a service allows you to specify the protocol and SSL settings for communication.
    question: What SSL settings are required when adding a SODEPS protocol input port in Jolie?
    answer: |
      When adding a SODEPS protocol input port, you must specify the `ssl.keyStore` and `ssl.keyStorePassword` to configure the SSL settings, as shown in the example:
      ```jolie
      protocol: sodeps {
          ssl.keyStore = "keystore.jks",
          ssl.keyStorePassword = "jolie!"
      }
      ```
  - context: |
      To run the service with the newly added SODEPS input port, you must execute the service in Jolie with the appropriate command.
    question: How do you run the Jolie service after adding the SODEPS input port?
    answer: |
      After adding the SODEPS input port, you can run the Jolie service with the following command:
      ```bash
      jolie AdvancedCalculatorService.ol
      ```
  - context: |
      To run a client that connects to the service using the SODEPS protocol, you also need to configure the output port in the client code.
    question: How do you configure the output port in the Jolie client to use SODEPS protocol?
    answer: |
      In the Jolie client, you configure the output port for SODEPS by specifying the `ssl.trustStore` and `ssl.trustStorePassword` settings. For example:
      ```jolie
      outputPort AdvancedCalculatorService {
          location: "socket://localhost:8006"
          protocol: sodeps {
              ssl.trustStore = "truststore.jks",
              ssl.trustStorePassword = "jolie!"
          }
          interfaces: AdvancedCalculatorInterface
      }
      ```
  - question: What is the purpose of `ssl.trustStore` and `ssl.trustStorePassword` in the client configuration?
    answer: |
      The `ssl.trustStore` and `ssl.trustStorePassword` settings in the client configuration are used to define the trust store for SSL communication, ensuring secure connections between the client and service.
