  - question: What does the wsdl2jolie tool do?
    answer: |
      The wsdl2jolie tool converts a WSDL document into Jolie port, interface, and data type definitions by parsing the document and its related files.
  - question: What is the syntax for using wsdl2jolie?
    answer: |
      The syntax is `wsdl2jolie wsdl_uri [output filename]`, where `wsdl_uri` can be a URL or file path, and the optional `[output filename]` saves the output to a specified file.
  - question: What does the wsdl2jolie output include?
    answer: |
      The output includes Jolie service declarations such as types, interfaces, and outputPorts needed for invoking the web service.
  - context: |
      wsdl2jolie allows specifying a WSDL URL or a local file path to generate Jolie service definitions.
    question: How can wsdl2jolie be used to process a local WSDL file?
    answer: |
      Use the syntax `wsdl2jolie <local file path>` to process the WSDL file and generate Jolie service definitions.
  - context: |
      A key benefit of wsdl2jolie is its ability to create a more human-readable Jolie equivalent of a WSDL document.
    question: What are the advantages of using wsdl2jolie?
    answer: |
      The advantages include creating a typed Jolie interface for a Web Service and producing a human-readable equivalent of the WSDL document.
  - question: How can the output from wsdl2jolie be used in Jolie code?
    answer: |
      The output can be saved into a file, included in Jolie programs, and used with outputPorts for invoking Web Services, as demonstrated in the provided example.
  - question: What parameters can be used in a SOAP outputPort generated by wsdl2jolie?
    answer: |
      Parameters include `wsdl` for the location of the WSDL document, `wsdl.port` for the related WSDL port, and `debug` to display SOAP messages if set to 1.
  - context: |
      The MetaService in the Jolie standard library can act as a bridge between Web Services using the SOAP protocol.
    question: How does the MetaService simplify Web Service interactions in Jolie?
    answer: |
      MetaService automatically downloads and caches the WSDL document and makes it callable by clients once configured with the correct protocol parameters.
  - context: |
      wsdl2jolie supports mapping between WSDL and Jolie elements, such as `<types>` to `type` and `<portType>` to `interface`.
    question: Can you provide an example of a WSDL-to-Jolie mapping?
    answer: |
      In wsdl2jolie, the WSDL `<types>` element maps to Jolie `type`, and `<portType>` maps to `interface`.
  - context: |
      Some features of WSDL and SOAP are not fully supported by wsdl2jolie, such as SOAP 1.2 and XML Schema Extended types.
    question: What limitations does wsdl2jolie have?
    answer: |
      wsdl2jolie does not support SOAP 1.2, XML Schema Extended types, and only partially supports HTTP GET and HTTP POST for Web Service calls.
