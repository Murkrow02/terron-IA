  - question: What does BTL2CAP stand for in Jolie?
    answer: |
      BTL2CAP stands for Bluetooth Logical Link Controller Adaptation Protocol and is used to transmit data via the Bluetooth medium.
  - question: What is the structure of a BTL2CAP location in Jolie?
    answer: |
      A BTL2CAP location in Jolie follows the format `btl2cap://hostname:UUID[;param1=val1;...;paramN=valN]`, where `hostname` identifies the host system, `UUID` is the universally unique identifier for the Bluetooth service, and `param1=val1` are optional Bluetooth-specific parameters.
  - question: What does the UUID represent in a BTL2CAP location?
    answer: |
      The UUID in a BTL2CAP location is a 128-bit unique identifier for the Bluetooth medium service, defined as a 32-character hexadecimal string.
  - question: What is the default value for the `authenticate` parameter in BTL2CAP?
    answer: |
      The default value for the `authenticate` parameter in BTL2CAP is `true`, meaning authentication is required to provide a particular Bluetooth service.
  - question: How can you configure encryption for Bluetooth communication in BTL2CAP?
    answer: |
      You can configure encryption by setting the `encrypt` parameter to `true`. By default, the encryption is set to `false`.
  - question: How would you define a BTL2CAP service that requires authentication and encryption in Jolie?
    answer: |
      You would define the BTL2CAP service with the parameters `authenticate=true` and `encrypt=true` in the location string. For example:
      ```jolie
      btl2cap://hostname:UUID;authenticate=true;encrypt=true
      ```
  - context: |
      type BTL2CAPParameters:void {
          .authenticate?: bool
          .encrypt?: bool
      }
    question: What is the purpose of the `authenticate` and `encrypt` parameters in BTL2CAP?
    answer: |
      The `authenticate` parameter controls whether authentication is required for the Bluetooth service, and the `encrypt` parameter controls whether the communication is encrypted among authenticated devices.
  - context: |
      type BTL2CAPParameters:void {
          .receivemtu?: string
          .transmitmtu?: string
      }
    question: What is the significance of the `receivemtu` and `transmitmtu` parameters in BTL2CAP?
    answer: |
      The `receivemtu` and `transmitmtu` parameters define the maximum transmission unit (MTU) for receiving and transmitting data, respectively. The default value for both is 672 bytes, and the supported values are 48 and 65536 bytes.
  - context: |
      type BTL2CAPParameters:void {
          .name?: string
      }
    question: What does the `name` parameter do in BTL2CAP?
    answer: |
      The `name` parameter defines a "friendly" name for the Bluetooth service, which can be used for identification. The default value is an empty string.
  - question: How would you define a BTL2CAP service with a custom name and MTU size?
    answer: |
      You would define the BTL2CAP service with the parameters `name="MyBluetoothService"` and `receivemtu="1024"`. For example:
      ```jolie
      btl2cap://hostname:UUID;name="MyBluetoothService";receivemtu="1024"
      ```
  - question: How do you configure the BTL2CAP service to allow communication only with authenticated devices?
    answer: |
      To allow communication only with authenticated devices, you would set the `authenticate` parameter to `true` and the `authorize` parameter to `false` (or omit it). For example:
      ```jolie
      btl2cap://hostname:UUID;authenticate=true;authorize=false
      ```
  - question: How would you configure a BTL2CAP service to always allow communication with a specific device?
    answer: |
      You can set the `authorize` parameter to `true` to allow communication with a particular authenticated device at all times. For example:
      ```jolie
      btl2cap://hostname:UUID;authenticate=true;authorize=true
      ```
  - context: |
      type BTL2CAPParameters:void {
          .master?: bool
      }
    question: What does the `master` parameter define in BTL2CAP?
    answer: |
      The `master` parameter defines whether the Bluetooth service acts as a master. By default, it is set to `false`.
  - question: What happens if you set the `master` parameter to `true` in a BTL2CAP location?
    answer: |
      Setting the `master` parameter to `true` makes the Bluetooth service act as the master device in the connection, allowing it to control the communication.
  - question: How can you specify the maximum MTU size for sending data in BTL2CAP?
    answer: |
      You can specify the maximum MTU size by setting the `transmitmtu` parameter. For example, to set the MTU size to 65536 bytes, you would use:
      ```jolie
      btl2cap://hostname:UUID;transmitmtu="65536"
      ```
