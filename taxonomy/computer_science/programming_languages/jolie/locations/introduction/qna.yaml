  - question: What are the five media supported by Jolie for location definitions?
    answer: |
      The five media supported by Jolie are local, socket, btl2cap, rmi, and localsocket.
  - question: How is a location defined in Jolie?
    answer: |
      A location in Jolie is defined as a URI in the form medium[:parameters], where medium is the medium identifier and parameters are optional, medium-specific strings.
  - question: What is the purpose of the 'auto' extension in Jolie?
    answer: |
      The 'auto' extension in Jolie allows for the automatic configuration of inputPort and outputPort locations from an external file, such as an ini or json file.
  - context: |
      A location can be automatically set from an external file using the 'auto' extension. For example, a file format like ini can define input and output port locations.
    question: |
      How can you automatically configure port locations using an ini file in Jolie?
    answer: |
      You can use the 'auto' extension with the format 'ini' to define locations. For example:
      ```jolie
      inputPort MyInput {
          location: "auto:ini:/Location/MyInput:file:config.ini"
          protocol: sodep
          interfaces: DummyInterface
      }
      ```
  - context: |
      A location can also be automatically set from a json file. In this case, the location path in the json file is referenced in the port definition.
    question: |
      How can you automatically configure port locations using a json file in Jolie?
    answer: |
      You can use the 'auto' extension with the format 'json' to define locations. For example:
      ```jolie
      inputPort MyInput {
          location: "auto:json:MyInput.location:file:config.json"
          protocol: sodep
          interfaces: DummyInterface
      }
      ```
  - question: What does the variable path in the 'auto' extension refer to when using ini and json files?
    answer: |
      The variable path refers to the specific location defined in the external file. For example, in an ini file, it could be "/Location/MyInput", while in a json file, it could be "MyInput.location".
  - question: What is the format of the location definition in an ini file for Jolie?
    answer: |
      In an ini file, the location definition follows the format: [section_name] followed by key-value pairs where the key is the port name and the value is the location URI.
      Example:
      ```ini
      [Location]
      MyInput=socket://localhost:8000
      MyOutput=socket://100.100.100.100:8000
      ```
  - question: How is the variable path used in a json file for Jolie location configuration?
    answer: |
      In a json file, the variable path is the key that specifies the location for the port, such as "MyInput.location".
      Example:
      ```json
      {
          "MyInput": {
              "location": "socket://localhost:8000"
          },
          "MyOutput": {
              "location": "socket://100.100.100.100:8000"
          }
      }
      ```
  - question: What are the two file formats supported by the 'auto' extension for configuring locations in Jolie?
    answer: |
      The two supported file formats are ini and json.
