  - question: How do you define a procedure in Jolie?
    answer: |
      In Jolie, a procedure is defined using the `define` keyword followed by the procedure name and a block of code. For example:
      ```jolie
      define procedureName
      {
          // code
      }
      ```
  - context: |
      In Jolie, the `define` keyword is used to define procedures. These procedures do not have local variable scope. Here's an example of defining a procedure and invoking it from the main procedure:
      ```jolie
      define sumProcedure
      {
          sum = x + y
      }
      main
      {
          x = 1;
          y = 2;
          sumProcedure
      }
      ```
    question: |
      How do you invoke a procedure in Jolie?
    answer: |
      You can invoke a procedure in Jolie by simply calling its name within the `main` procedure or any other procedure. For example, `sumProcedure` is called in the `main` procedure in the example above.
  - question: What is the purpose of the `main` procedure in Jolie?
    answer: |
      The `main` procedure in Jolie is the entry point of the program, where the execution starts. It can invoke other defined procedures as needed.
  - context: |
      In Jolie, auxiliary procedures can be defined and invoked from other procedures. Unlike some languages, Jolie procedures do not have a local variable scope, meaning variables are shared across the procedures within the same instance.
    question: |
      How are variables handled in procedures in Jolie?
    answer: |
      In Jolie, variables are shared across all procedures within the same instance because procedures do not have local variable scope.
  - question: How is the code block of a procedure structured in Jolie?
    answer: |
      The code block of a procedure in Jolie is enclosed within curly braces `{ ... }`, where the actual procedure logic is defined.
