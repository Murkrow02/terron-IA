  - question: What is the syntax to declare constants in Jolie?
    answer: |
      The syntax to declare constants in Jolie is:
      ```
      constants {
          const1 = val1,
          const2 = val2,
          ...
          constn = valn
      }
      ```
  - question: How can you override a constant value on the command line in Jolie?
    answer: |
      To override a constant value on the command line in Jolie, use the `-C` option. For example:
      ```
      jolie -C server_location="socket://localhost:4003" program.ol
      ```
  - question: What is the purpose of the `-C` option in Jolie?
    answer: |
      The `-C` option in Jolie allows overriding constants from the command line during program execution.
  - context: |
      constants {
          Server_location = "socket://localhost:8080",
          ALARM_TIMEOUT = 2000,
          standard_gravity = 9.8
      }
    question: |
      What are some examples of constants you can define in Jolie?
    answer: |
      Examples of constants in Jolie are:
      - `Server_location` set to `"socket://localhost:8080"`
      - `ALARM_TIMEOUT` set to `2000`
      - `standard_gravity` set to `9.8`
  - context: |
      Under Windows, `=` is a parameter delimiter.
    question: |
      How should you format the `-C` option on Windows to correctly assign constants?
    answer: |
      On Windows, you should enclose the assignment of the constant in single or double quotes. For example:
      ```
      jolie -C "server_location=\"socket://localhost:4003\"" program.ol
      ```
  - question: What happens if you remove a constant declaration from the `constants` list in Jolie and use the `-C` option?
    answer: |
      If you remove a constant declaration from the `constants` list in Jolie, you can make the constant assignment mandatory using the `-C` option when running the program.
  - context: |
      constants {
          ALARM_TIMEOUT = 2000,
          standard_gravity = 9.8
      }
    question: |
      How do you declare a constant for an alarm timeout in Jolie?
    answer: |
      To declare a constant for an alarm timeout in Jolie, use:
      ```
      constants {
          ALARM_TIMEOUT = 2000
      }
      ```
