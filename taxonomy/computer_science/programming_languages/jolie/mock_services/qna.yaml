  - question: What is the purpose of the `joliemock` command in Jolie?
    answer: |
      The `joliemock` command generates a mock service that provides a fake implementation of all the operations defined in an inputPort.
  - question: How do you save the generated mock service into a file?
    answer: |
      You can save the generated mock service by redirecting the output of the `joliemock` command into a file using the `>` operator. For example: `joliemock example.ol > mock_main.ol`.
  - question: What are the parameters accepted by the `joliemock` command?
    answer: |
      The `joliemock` command accepts the following parameters:
      - `<filename>`: Specifies the file containing the service definition.
      - `-port <portname>`: Specifies the input port to be mocked. If not defined, the first port is used.
      - `-depth <vector depth>`: Specifies the number of elements to be generated for each vector. The default is 5.

      type TestRequest: void {
          field1: string
          field2: int
          field3: void {
              field4*: long
          }
      }
      interface TestInterface {
          RequestResponse:
              test( TestRequest )( TestResponse )
      }
      inputPort PortName {
          Location: "local"
          Protocol: sodep
          Interfaces: TestInterface
      }
    question: |
      How do you generate a mock service for the `PortName` inputPort?
    answer: |
      To generate a mock service for the `PortName` inputPort, use the command: `joliemock <filename>` where `<filename>` contains the service definition.
  - context: |
      type TestResponse: void {
          field5: string
          field6: string
          field7: double
          field8*: string
          field9: void {
              field10: string
              field11*: string
          }
      }
      main {
          nullProcess
      }
    question: |
      What is the default behavior of the mock service generated by `joliemock` for an operation?
    answer: |
      The default behavior of the mock service is to provide a basic, pre-defined implementation for the operations, including placeholder values for response fields.
  - question: Can you specify the number of elements generated for vectors in a mock service?
    answer: |
      Yes, you can specify the number of elements for vectors using the `-depth` parameter in the `joliemock` command. For example: `joliemock example.ol -depth 10`.
  - question: Why is it important to define the location of the inputPort when executing a mock service?
    answer: |
      Defining the location of the inputPort, such as `local`, ensures that the mock service operates correctly by binding to the specified address or endpoint.
