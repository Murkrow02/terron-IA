To implement simple communication between Jolie components using a socket, follow these steps:
1. Define a socket component in your Jolie program as follows:
```jolie
import socket;

component Main {
    input _socket = socket.create("localhost", "5000");
}
```
This component creates an anonymous socket connection to the default host (localhost) on port 5000.
2. Define a second component that will listen for incoming messages and respond accordingly:
```jolie
component Receiver {
    input _socket = socket.create("localhost", "5000");
    output _response;

    event _message = { message: str };
}
```
3. Start the Receiver component first, then start the Main component:
```jolie
component Main {
    input _socket = socket.create("localhost", "5000");

    when (on_start) {
        _socket = socket.connect();
    }
}
```
4. In the Main component, send a message to the Receiver component:
```jolie
component Main {
    input _socket = socket.create("localhost", "5000");

    when (on_start) {
        _socket = socket.connect();
        print(s"Hello World!");
        _socket.write({ message: "Hello from Main!" });
    }
}
```
5. In the Receiver component, handle the incoming message and respond accordingly:
```jolie
component Receiver {
    input _socket = socket.create("localhost", "5000");
    output _response;

    event _message = { message: str };

    when (on_start) {
        _socket = socket.listen();
    }

    when (on_message, _message) {
        print(s"Got the message '$_message' from Main!");
        _response = {"message": "Hello back from Receiver!"};
        _socket.write(_response);
    }
}
```
This example demonstrates how to create a simple socket communication system between two Jolie components, with one
sending a "Hello World" message and the other responding accordingly. You can further customize and expand this
setup to meet your specific needs.
