Sure, here's the Jolie code for two simple programs that can communicate:

Program A (the sender):
```jolie
import std.stdio;
import std.net;

main() {
    println("Hello World");
    sendMessage("My message to Program B", "127.0.0.1", 8080);
}
```

Program B (the receiver):
```jolie
import std.stdio;
import std.net;

main() {
    while (true) {
        receiveMessage();
    }
}

func receiveMessage() {
    println("Received message: ${message}");
}
```

To run these programs, you need to have Jolie installed on your system. You can download it from the official
website: (http://jolie-lang.org/). Once you have Jolie installed, build and run Program A using the following
command in your terminal:
```bash
$ jde main.jolie
$ ./main
```

Now, if you run Program B in another terminal window or tab, you should be able to see the "Received message:"
output in Program A once Program B has received the message.
