In Jolie, both `process` and `session` concepts are related to communication and interaction between components or
services. However, they serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics:

- **Processes** in Jolie refer to the runtime environment where components or services execute. A process can be
thought of as an isolated environment with its own resources and execution context. Processes communicate with each
other through messages, which are sent and received at the network level. Each process has its own memory space and
runs in a separate address space.

- **Sessions** in Jolie represent the stateful communication between processes or services. A session is a
communication channel that persists over time, allowing components to maintain their context and exchange data
consistently. Sessions are designed to provide a higher level of interaction and coordination between different
components compared to simple process-to-process communication.

To expand on sessions in Jolie, they offer several features that make it easier for developers to create complex
applications:

1. **Decoupling**: Sessions decouple the individual components by allowing them to communicate asynchronously and
independently. This enables components to focus on their specific tasks without being tied to their counterparts'
behavior or state.
2. **Persistence**: Sessions maintain a history of exchanges between components, which can be used for state
management, caching, and session recovery. This feature is essential for building scalable and resilient
applications where maintaining context is important.
3. **Interoperability**: Sessions enable communication between different components or services running in separate
processes or containers. This interoperability allows developers to create complex systems using various
technologies and frameworks.
4. **Security**: Sessions provide mechanisms for securing the communication between components, such as
authentication, encryption, and access control. These features ensure that data exchanged through sessions remains
confidential and is only accessible to authorized parties.
