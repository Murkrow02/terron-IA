In Jolie, database connection management is handled through the use of connection pools, which are essentially
predefined lists of open connections to a database. These pools help manage and optimize the use of database
resources by reusing existing connections instead of creating new ones for each request. This can lead to improved
performance, reduced resource usage, and lower latency when working with multiple database connections in Jolie
applications.

To create and utilize database connection pools in Jolie, you can follow these steps:

1. First, define a connection pool interface in your application module:

```jolie
interface DatabaseConnectionPool {
    openConnection(connectionPoolName: String): Connection;
    closeConnection(connection: Connection): Unit;
}
```

Replace `connectionPoolName` with the name of the desired connection pool.

2. Implement your own connection pool class, implementing the above interface and providing methods to open a new
connection or close an existing one:

```jolie
class SQLiteConnectionPool implements DatabaseConnectionPool {
    private val databasePath: String;
    private val databaseVersion: String;

    // Other code

    override fun openConnection(connectionPoolName: String): Connection {
        // Open a new connection to the specified database path and version
        // ...
    }

    override fun closeConnection(connection: Connection): Unit {
        // Close the specified connection
        // ...
    }
}
```

3. In your main Jolie module, create an instance of the connection pool and configure it with the appropriate
database path and version:

```jolie
class MyMainModule {
    private val databaseConnectionPool = SQLiteConnectionPool(// config
)

// Use the databaseConnectionPool as needed in other parts of your application

fun openConnection() -> Connection {
    return databaseConnectionPool.openConnection("my_database")
}
```

4. In other parts of your application, use the `openConnection()` function to obtain a connection from the pool:

```jolie
import MyMainModule as mod;

fun main() {
    // Get a connection from the pool
    val connection = mod.openConnection();
    // Use the connection here ...
}
```
