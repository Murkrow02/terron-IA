Jolie, formerly known as Apache Jolie, is a statically typed, expressive, and modular programming language designed
for developing robust web applications. It provides built-in support for handling RESTful APIs through its `rest`
module, which simplifies the creation of RESTful endpoints and services.

To implement a REST API in Jolie, you can use the following steps:
1. Define your resources: First, define the resources that will be part of your API using Jolie's built-in
`resource` type. Each resource represents a distinct entity or concept in your system.
2. Implement CRUD operations: Next, implement the Create (POST), Read (GET), Update (PUT/PATCH), and Delete
(DELETE) operations for each resource. These operations are commonly referred to as CRUD, and they allow you to
manage data within your API.
3. Handle requests: In Jolie, you can handle HTTP requests using its built-in `http` module. The `request` type
represents a single HTTP request, and you can use it to extract information from the request and prepare a
response.
4. Serve requests: Finally, serve your RESTful APIs by combining resources, CRUD operations, and HTTP handling into
a single module or application. Jolie's built-in `router` module helps you map routes and manage incoming requests.

Here is an example of how to implement a simple RESTful API for managing users in Jolie:
```jolie
import jolie;
import jolie.http;
import jolie.resource as resources;
import jolie.router as router;

type User = resources.User;

module UserResource {
    @router.Route("/api/users")
    export const usersApi = {
        get: async [User](req) => {
            // Implement CRUD operations for managing users
        },
        post: async [User](payload) => {
            // Implement CRUD operations for creating new users
        }
    };

    let server = jolie.http.Server(8080);

    await server.listen();
}
```
