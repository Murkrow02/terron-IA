Jolie provides built-in support for RESTful APIs through its `rest` module, which simplifies the process of
creating web services and interacting with APIs. The `rest` module allows developers to define endpoints, request
methods, response formats, and data types using a declarative and concise syntax.

When implementing REST APIs in Jolie, you can define endpoints using the `resource` statement followed by a list of
endpoints that correspond to different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). Each endpoint can include parameters,
query strings, and headers for controlling the behavior of the API.

Here's an example of how to define a GET endpoint in Jolie:
```jolie
module myapp {
  import rest = jolie.rest;

  resource MyResource {
    / Some endpoint that corresponds to the GET HTTP method
    endpoint /myendpoint(id : int) -> (result : string) {
      // Handle the request and return a response
    }

    / Another endpoint that corresponds to the POST HTTP method
    endpoint /anotherendpoint(data : any) -> (status : int, message : string) {
      // Handle the request and return a response
    }
  }
}
```
In this example, `MyResource` is an abstraction that defines two endpoints: `/myendpoint` which corresponds to the
GET HTTP method and `/anotherendpoint` which corresponds to the POST HTTP method. The `import rest = jolie.rest;`
statement imports the `rest` module from Jolie's standard library, allowing developers to use its functionality for
implementing REST APIs.

To handle the request and return a response, you can define methods inside the resource definition using the
`@method` and `@response` annotations. These annotations provide information about the HTTP method and response
format for each endpoint. For example, in `/myendpoint`, the `@method` annotation specifies that this endpoint
corresponds to the GET HTTP method, and the `@response` annotation specifies that the response should be of type
`string`.

Similarly, in `/anotherendpoint`, the `@method` annotation specifies that this endpoint corresponds to the POST
HTTP method, and the `@response` annotation specifies that the response should include two elements: a `status`
integer and a `message` string.

Here's an example of how to handle the request and return a response in `/myendpoint`:
```jolie
import rest = jolie.rest;

resource MyResource {
  @method GET /myendpoint(id : int) -> (result : string) {
    // Handle the request and return a response
    let id = request.params.id;

    result = "Hello, " + id;
    return result;
  }
}
```
In this example, the `MyResource` resource defines an endpoint `@method GET /myendpoint(id : int)` that corresponds
to the GET HTTP method. When a request is made to this endpoint, the `@handleRequest` method is called, which
retrieves the ID from the request's parameters (`request.params.id`). The response is then constructed and returned
using the `@response` annotation and the `result` variable.
