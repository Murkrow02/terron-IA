Jolie, formerly known as JSR233, is a statically typed functional programming language that supports both
procedural and object-oriented programming paradigms. It was designed for building scalable, high-performance
applications and APIs. When dealing with RESTful APIs in Jolie, you can use the built-in `net` library to create
and manage HTTP requests and responses. Here's a simple example of how to implement a GET request using Jolie:
```jolie
import net from "net";

myService: net.HTTPServer {
  on Request {
    let url = "https://api.example.com/users";
    println(url);
    response: net.HTTPResponse {
      statusCode: 200;
      body: String["Hello, Jolie!");
    };
  }
}
```
In this example, a new HTTP server is created using the `myService` label and a GET request is defined to the URL
`https://api.example.com/users`. The response will be a JSON object with the message "Hello, Jolie!" if the request
is successful.
