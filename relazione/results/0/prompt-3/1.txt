Jolie, the open-source web framework for building serverless applications with Rust, manages database connections
using the "sql" crate. The sql crate provides an SQL query compiler that translates higher-level SQL statements
into a series of native calls to the underlying database driver. This abstraction enables Jolie to work with
various databases by wrapping their proprietary APIs with a consistent interface.

To use the sql crate in your Jolie application, follow these steps:

1. Add the sql crate to your `Cargo.toml` file:
```toml

sql = "0.37.0"
```
2. Import the `sql::{Database, Query}` modules in your source code:
```rust
use sql::Database;
use sql::Query;
```
3. Create a database connection pool using the `Database` class. This pool can be shared across multiple functions
or modules.
```rust
let mut db = Database::connect("mysql://user:password@localhost/database").unwrap();
db_pool = db.unwrap();
```
4. Wrap your database queries with the `Query` struct to ensure proper transaction management and error handling.
```rust
let result = Query::new(
    "SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 18",
    &mut db_pool,
).execute().unwrap();
```
5. Perform other operations on the database connection pool as needed.

In the examples below, I'll demonstrate how to use the `sql` crate to interact with a SQLite database.

Example 1: Connecting to a SQLite database

```rust
use sql::{Database, Query};

fn main() {
    let mut db = Database::connect("sqlite:///example.db").unwrap();

    db_pool = db.unwrap();

    let result = Query::new(
        "SELECT * FROM users",
        &mut db_pool,
    ).execute().unwrap();
}
```

In this example, we create a `Database` instance and connect to the SQLite database named `example.db`. We then
wrap the query with the `Query` struct and execute it using the `execute()` method.

Example 2: Performing a SQL DELETE operation

```rust
use sql::{Database, Query};

fn main() {
    let mut db = Database::connect("sqlite:///example.db").unwrap();

    db_pool = db.unwrap();

    let query = Query::new(
        "DELETE FROM users WHERE id = 1",
        &mut db_pool,
    ).unwrap();

    let result = query.execute().unwrap();
}
```

In this example, we create a `Query` instance with a DELETE statement and wrap it with the `Query` struct. We then
execute the query using the `execute()` method.

These examples demonstrate how to use the `sql` crate in Jolie to manage database connections. You can adapt these
examples to work with different databases by changing the connection string and adjusting the query statements
accordingly.

Keep in mind that the `sql` crate supports various advanced features, such as transaction management, statement
caching, and more. For a complete list of features and APIs, consult the official documentation:
