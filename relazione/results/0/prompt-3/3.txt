Jolie, a modern web framework for building serverless applications using Rust, utilizes the `tufs` library for
handling database connections. The `tufs` library is designed to simplify the process of connecting to various
databases and providing a consistent interface across different backends.

To create a connection pool in Jolie, you can use the `Pool` type from the `tufs` library. Here's an example of how
to create a connection pool for PostgreSQL:

```rust
use tufs::pool::Pool;

#
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let url = "postgresql://user:password@localhost/database_name".to_string();

    let pool = Pool::connect(url).await?;

    // Now you can use the pool to get connections
    let connection = pool.borrow().await?;

    let mut statement = connection
        .prepare("SELECT * FROM users")
        .await?;

    // Execute a query using the statement
    let result = statement.execute().await?;

    // Close the connection and return
    result.close();

    Ok(())
}
```
In this example, we first create a `Pool` instance using the `Pool::connect()` method. The `url` parameter is a
string containing the connection URL for PostgreSQL. We then borrow the pool to obtain a connection using
`pool.borrow()`. Once we have a connection, we can use it to execute queries by calling `connection.prepare()` and
passing in a query string.

Once the query is executed, we close the connection using the `result.close()` method. After that, we return
immediately from the main function.

It's important to note that Jolie uses the Rust `async/await` paradigm for asynchronous programming, which allows
you to write concurrent code that is safe, reliable, and easy to understand. The `tokio::main` macro is used to
start a new Tokio event loop, where the code inside the loop will be executed asynchronously.

In summary, Jolie uses the `tufs` library to manage database connections, providing a consistent interface for
connecting to various databases. By using the `Pool` type from `tufs`, you can easily create connection pools and
manage database connections in your Jolie applications.
