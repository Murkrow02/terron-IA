Jolie, the open-source web application framework for Rust, utilizes the "client-server" pattern for database
connections. This means that the application (client) makes a request to the database server to perform operations
like querying or updating data. Jolie provides a low-level `Pool` type for managing database connections and a
higher-level `Database` trait for simplifying database interactions.

Here's a basic example of how to use Jolie's `Pool` type to create a connection pool for a SQLite database:

```rust
use jolie::{ConnectionPool, Database};

#
struct User {
    id: u32,
    name: String,
}

impl Database for User {
    fn connect(&self) -> Result<ConnectionPool<User>, SQLiteError> {
        let database_path = "users.db";
        let connection_pool = ConnectionPool::new(database_path).map_err(|e| e)?;

        Ok(connection_pool)
    }

    fn execute(&self, query: &str, args: &[&str]) -> Result<u32, SQLiteError> {
        let connection_pool = self.connect().unwrap();
        let mut cursor = connection_pool.borrow_mut().query(query).expect("Failed to query the database");
        let result = cursor.execute_all(&args);
        cursor.close();
        Ok(result)
    }
}

fn main() {
    let user = User{ id: 1, name: "John Doe".to_string() };

    match user.database().connect() {
        Ok(_) => println!("Connected to the database successfully."),
        Err(e) => eprintln!("Failed to connect to the database: {}", e),
    }

    match user.database().execute("SELECT * FROM users") {
        Ok(result) => println!("Executed the query successfully: {}", result),
        Err(e) => eprintln!("Failed to execute the query: {}", e),
    }
}
```

In this example, we define a simple `User` struct and implement the `Database` trait for it. The `Database` trait
provides methods for connecting to the database and executing queries. We then create a connection pool for SQLite
using Jolie's `ConnectionPool` type and use it to interact with the database.
