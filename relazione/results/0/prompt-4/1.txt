Certainly! To create a simple communication channel between two Jolie programs, follow these steps:

1. Create a new Jolie program called `sender.jolie` and define a function called `send_message` that takes a string
as an argument and returns a Jolie message containing the string.

```jolie
import jolie.io.Message;
import jolie.runtime.Runtime;

// Create a new sender program
def sender(runtime):
    // Define the send_message function
    def send_message(message: String): Message {
        // Create an empty message object
        var message_obj = runtime.create_message();

        // Add the "Hello World" string to the message
        message_obj.add_text("Hello World");

        return message_obj;
    }

    // Return the send_message function
    return {send_message};
}
```

2. Create a new Jolie program called `receiver.jolie` and define a function called `receive_message` that listens
for incoming messages and prints them to the console.

```jolie
import jolie.io.Message;
import jolie.runtime.Runtime;

// Create a new receiver program
def receiver(runtime):
    // Define the receive_message function
    def receive_message(message: Message): void {
        // Print the message to the console
        console.log("Received message: " + message.text);
    }

    // Register the receive_message function
    runtime.register_function("receive_message", receive_message);

    // Return the receive_message function
    return {receive_message};
}
```

3. Start the sender program and send a message to the receiver program:

```bash
jolie --runtime=granite-7b-base --exec=sender sender.jolie
```

4. Start the receiver program and wait for incoming messages:

```bash
jolie --runtime=granite-7b-base --exec=receiver receiver.jolie
```

5. Send a message from the sender program to the receiver program:

```bash
sender.jolie send_message "Hello World"
```

6. The receiver program should print the following message to the console:

```
Received message: Hello World
```

This example demonstrates how to create a simple communication channel between two Jolie programs using the
`send_message` and `receive_message` functions. You can modify and expand this example to create more complex
communication scenarios between multiple Jolie programs.

Keep in mind that the code examples provided are for educational purposes and should be adapted to your specific
use case. Make sure to follow best practices for secure and reliable communication between Jolie programs.
