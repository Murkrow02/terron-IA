Certainly! Here's a simple example of how you can create two Jolie programs that exchange "Hello World" messages
using the `jolie/std.stream` and `jolie/std.message` packages:

First, let's create the sender program:

```jolie
// sender.jl
import jolie.std.stream as s
import jolie.std.message as m

func main() {
    // Create a sender channel
    channel = s.connect("localhost", 8080)

    // Send a message to the channel
    m.message("Hello World") >>= (reply, error) ->
        println("Received: ", reply)
        if error is not nil
            println("Error: ", error)
    channel <<=" 'Hello World'"
}
```

Next, let's create the receiver program:

```jolie
// receiver.jl
import jolie.std.stream as s
import jolie.std.message as m

func main() {
    // Create a receiver channel
    channel = s.connect("localhost", 8080)

    // Receive messages from the channel
    m.message >>= (reply, error) ->
        println("Received: ", reply)
        if error is not nil
            println("Error: ", error)
    channel <<=" 'Hello World'"
}
```

In this example, both programs use the `s.connect` function to create a TCP/IP connection to the local host on port
8080. The `channel` variable is used to represent the connection.

The `sender.jl` program sends a "Hello World" message to the channel using the `channel <<=" 'Hello World'"`
expression. The `receiver.jl` program listens for messages on the channel using the `m.message >>= (reply, error)
->` expression and prints the received message.

To run the sender program:

```jolie
julia sender.jl
```

To run the receiver program:

```jolie
julia receiver.jl
```

This will create a TCP/IP connection to the local host on port 8080 and send a "Hello World" message to the other
program. The other program will then print "Received: Hello World".

Keep in mind that you may need to adjust the port number if the default port (8080) is already in use on your
machine. You can find the current list of open ports using the `lsof` command in your terminal or shell.
