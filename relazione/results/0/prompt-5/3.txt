Certainly! Here's an example of how you could implement a simple calculator in Jolie that supports basic arithmetic
operations:

```jolie
class Calculator {
  string input;
  int number1, number2, result;

  // Initialize the calculator with empty inputs
  void start() {
    input = "";
    number1 = 0;
    number2 = 0;
    result = 0;
  }

  // Handle enter key press
  void enterKeyPressed() {
    if (input.length() > 0) {
      String operation = input.substring(0, 1);
      input = input.substring(1);

      switch (operation) {
        case "+":
          result = number1 + number2;
          break;
        case "-":
          result = number1 - number2;
          break;
        case "/":
          if (number2 == 0) {
            throw new JolieException("Invalid operation, divide by zero not allowed.");
          }
          result = number1 / number2;
          break;
        case "*":
          if (number2 == 0) {
            throw new JolieException("Invalid operation, multiply by zero not allowed.");
          }
          result = number1 * number2;
          break;
      }
    }
  }

  // Handle arrow up key press
  void arrowUpKeyPressed() {
    if (input.length() > 0) {
      result = result - Integer.parseInt(input);
      input = "";
    }
  }

  // Handle arrow down key press
  void arrowDownKeyPressed() {
    if (input.length() > 0) {
      result = result + Integer.parseInt(input);
      input = "";
    }
  }

  // Display the current result
  void displayResult() {
    System.out.println("Current Result: " + result);
  }
}
```

To use this calculator, you can create an instance of the `Calculator` class and call its methods to perform
arithmetic operations. For example, to add two numbers, you could call `calculator.add()`. To subtract one number
from another, you could call `calculator.subtract()`. To divide one number by another, you could call
`calculator.divide()`, and so on.

To communicate with the calculator, you can create a Jolie application that creates an instance of the `Calculator`
class and calls its methods to perform arithmetic operations. Here's an example of how you could do this:

```jolie
// Create an instance of the Calculator class
val calculator = Calculator()

// Add two numbers
calculator.add("+", "2", "3")

// Subtract one number from another
calculator.subtract("/", "2", "1")

// Divide one number by another (note that this will throw an exception if the denominator is zero)
try {
  calculator.divide("-", "2", "0")
} catch (e: JolieException) {
  println("Error dividing by zero.")
}

// Multiply one number by another
calculator.multiply("*", "2", "3")
```

This example demonstrates how you can create a Jolie application that communicates with the `Calculator` class to
perform basic arithmetic operations. Note that this is just one possible way to interact with the calculator, and
there are many other ways you could implement this functionality in Jolie.
