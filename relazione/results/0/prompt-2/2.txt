In Jolie, a process is an instance of a task that runs independently in the system. It has its own memory space,
and it can have multiple children processes to help it accomplish its goals. Processes are used to encapsulate the
business logic of an application, and they communicate with each other through a mechanism called communication
endpoints.

A session, on the other hand, is a coordination point between two or more processes. It provides a shared
communication space where these processes can exchange data and synchronize their actions. Sessions are essential
for building distributed applications that require coordinated execution of multiple tasks.

In Jolie, sessions are implemented as channels, which are bidirectional communication endpoints. Channels allow
processes to send messages to each other, and they can also be used for exchanging data between processes in a way
that is transparent to the application code. Sessions can be used to coordinate the execution of multiple tasks,
manage resources, and ensure data consistency across the system.

To elaborate further, sessions in Jolie are implemented using the Reliable Connections (RC) protocol, which
provides a reliable and efficient way for processes to communicate with each other. The RC protocol ensures that
messages are delivered in the correct order, even in the presence of network failures or high latency. It also
supports message acknowledgements, flow control, and connection termination, making it suitable for building
scalable and fault-tolerant systems.

In summary, processes and sessions in Jolie serve different purposes. Processes encapsulate the business logic of
an application, while sessions provide a coordination point between multiple processes, enabling them to
communicate and synchronize their actions in a distributed system. The use of sessions and processes in Jolie
allows developers to build scalable, fault-tolerant, and efficient applications that can run on a wide range of
platforms and environments.
