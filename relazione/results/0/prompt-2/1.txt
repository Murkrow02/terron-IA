In Jolie, a process is an isolated environment where a specific task or set of tasks are executed. It serves as a
container for code, libraries, and resources that are necessary for the task at hand. Processes are independent of
each other, and they communicate with each other through well-defined interfaces, such as APIs or message queues.
This isolation allows for better modularity, scalability, and security in Jolie applications.

A session, on the other hand, is a more abstract concept that represents a coordinated interaction between multiple
processes. Sessions are responsible for managing the flow of data and messages between processes, ensuring that
they are delivered in the correct order and that duplicate or out-of-order messages are handled appropriately.

In Jolie, sessions are implemented using a combination of language features, libraries, and runtime services. The
language provides support for asynchronous communication, while libraries and runtime services offer additional
features, such as message serialization and deserialization, message routing, and session management.

To elaborate further, sessions in Jolie can be used to implement various coordination patterns, such as message
passing, remote procedure calls, or event-driven architectures. By using sessions, developers can create
applications that are more flexible, scalable, and resilient to failures.

In summary, processes and sessions in Jolie serve different purposes. Processes provide an isolated environment for
executing tasks, while sessions manage the flow of data and messages between multiple processes, enabling
coordinated interactions and improving the overall design and functionality of Jolie applications.
