In Jolie, processes are independent entities that can execute code and manage resources. They have their own memory
space, execution context, and system resources. Processes communicate with each other through messages or channels,
which are explicit communication endpoints. Processes can be spawned from a single parent process or created
independently.

Sessions, on the other hand, represent a shared communication context between two processes. Sessions provide a
more secure and isolated way of communicating compared to direct process-to-process communication. By using
sessions, you can ensure that messages are only accessible to the intended recipient, enhancing security and data
privacy.

A session is created when two processes establish a connection and agree on the communication protocols. Once a
session is established, the participating processes can exchange messages and synchronize their actions. Sessions
can be used to coordinate between multiple processes, manage resources, or implement distributed algorithms.

In summary, processes are independent entities that communicate through channels, while sessions provide a shared
communication context for multiple processes to collaborate securely.
