Jolie, like other programming languages, supports the creation of RESTful APIs through its built-in features and
libraries. It utilizes HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to interact with resources and follows the principles
of Representational State Transfer (REST) for better architectural compatibility.

To implement a RESTful API in Jolie, you can use the `rest` module, which provides a simple and flexible way to
create APIs. The `rest` module offers classes for handling different HTTP methods and resources, making it easier
to build RESTful APIs without having to write extensive boilerplate code.

Here's an example of how to create a simple POST request using the `rest` module:

```jolie
from jolie import app, url_lib, rest

@app.route("/api/v1/users", methods=["POST"])
def create_user():
    name = request.json.get("name")
    email = request.json.get("email")
    password = bcrypt.hashpw(request.json.get("password"), bcrypt.salt)

    new_user = User(name, email, password)
    db.session.add(new_user)
    db.session.commit()

    return "User created successfully.", 201
```
In this example, the `rest` module is used to handle the POST request to the `/api/v1/users` endpoint. The class
`User` is created to manage the user data and the database operations.

Jolie also supports JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for handling authentication and authorization. You can use libraries like
`jwt-python` to generate and validate JWTs.

In summary, Jolie provides a convenient way to build RESTful APIs using its built-in `rest` module and other
libraries for specific functionalities. The language supports the principles of REST and offers a modern and
efficient way to develop web applications.
