Jolie is a statically typed superset of C++ that adds features for modern programming, such as concurrency and
parallelism, metaprogramming, and improved language expressiveness. It supports RESTful web services through its
built-in support for web APIs and the use of standard libraries and frameworks.

When implementing RESTful web services in Jolie, developers can leverage the language's features to create
efficient and maintainable code. Jolie provides a simple and intuitive way to define resources, endpoints, and
request/response handling mechanisms.

Jolie uses a combination of language features and standard libraries to support RESTful web services:

1. Resources: In Jolie, resources are defined using the `resource` keyword. A resource is a logical entity that
represents a specific functionality provided by the system. For example, a resource could represent a user, an
order, or a product.
2. Endpoints: Endpoints are associated with a resource and define the URL paths that can be used to access the
resource. In Jolie, endpoints are defined using the `endpoint` keyword, followed by the resource name and the HTTP
method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
3. Request/Response handling: Jolie provides built-in support for handling requests and responses using the
`request` and `response` keywords. The `request` keyword is used to define the input data for a request, while the
`response` keyword is used to define the output data generated by the system.
4. Standard libraries: Jolie includes standard libraries for common web service tasks, such as parsing and
serializing data, handling authentication and authorization, and managing session state.

For example, here's a simple RESTful endpoint in Jolie that allows users to create new orders:
```jolie
resource Order {
  endpoint("/orders") {
    post() {
      request => {
        header("Content-Type", "application/json")
        body(string)
      }
      response => {
        status(201)
        header("Location", "/order")
        body(string)
      }
    }
  }
}
```
In this example, the `Order` resource has an endpoint at `/orders` that uses the `post()` method to handle
requests. The `request` keyword is used to define the input data, which should be a JSON object in this case. The
`response` keyword is used to define the output data, which includes a new order ID and a redirect to the order
details page.

Jolie's support for RESTful web services makes it easy to build scalable and efficient systems that can interact
with other services and applications. By using Jolie's built-in features and standard libraries, developers can
create web services that are secure, maintainable, and easy to deploy.
