Jolie is a statically-typed, multi-paradigm programming language that supports both functional and object-oriented
programming styles. It also provides built-in support for creating and consuming RESTful APIs, which can be an
excellent choice for building web services and APIs that adhere to the REpresentational State Transfer (REST)
architectural principles.

When implementing RESTful APIs with Jolie, you can define endpoints using the `@endpoint` directive, followed by a
method name and HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.). For example:

```jolie
// Define an endpoint for a resource called "users"
@endpoint
class UsersEndpoint {
  def getUser(id: Int): Response<User> = {
    // Implement the GET request handling logic here
  }

  def postUser(user: User): Response<User> = {
    // Implement the POST request handling logic here
  }
}
```

Inside the `UsersEndpoint` class, you can define methods for handling HTTP requests and returning responses. The
`Response<T>` type is used to represent the response payload and status code. Jolie also supports various JSON
serialization and deserialization libraries, such as `jolie-json`, to simplify working with JSON data.

When implementing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, you can use the HTTP methods mentioned above to
handle the different operations:

- Create a new user: `POST /users`
- Retrieve a user by ID: `GET /users/123`
- Update a user by ID: `PATCH /users/123`
- Delete a user by ID: `DELETE /users/123`

Jolie's built-in support for RESTful APIs, along with its statically-typed nature, can help ensure that your API is
well-documented, maintainable, and secure. Additionally, Jolie's support for various programming paradigms allows
you to choose the best approach for your specific use case.
