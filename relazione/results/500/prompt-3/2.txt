Jolie, as a programming language for AI applications, supports various databases through its extensive database
integration capabilities. When working with Jolie, developers can easily establish connections to relational
databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and NoSQL databases like MongoDB using Jolie's built-in `database` module.

To create a connection to a relational database in Jolie, you need to first import the `database` package:
```jolie
import database.Database;
```
Next, create a `DatabaseConnection` object that represents the connection to the database:
```jolie
val myDatabase = Database();
```
Finally, open the connection and execute a SQL query:
```jolie
myDatabase.openDatabase("myDatabaseName").select().from("tableName")
                 .where("someCondition")
                 .execute().foreach(|result| println(s"The result is ${result.length} records"));
```
In this example, we open the connection to the `myDatabaseName` database, select data from the `tableName` table,
apply a specific condition, and then print the number of records returned by the query.

To establish a connection to a NoSQL database, you can use Jolie's built-in `dbclient` package as follows:
```jolie
import dbclient.{DatabaseClient, MongoDB} from "dbclient";
import com.mongodb.DB;
```
First, import the necessary packages:
```jolie
import database.Database;
import dbclient.{DatabaseClient, MongoDB} from "dbclient";
import com.mongodb.DB;
```
Next, create a `DatabaseClient` object that represents the connection to the database:
```jolie
val myMongoClient = DatabaseClient("localhost", 27017);
```
Finally, connect to the MongoDB database and execute a query:
```jolie
myMongoClient.connect(DB("myDatabaseName").get()).foreach(|result| println(s"The result is ${result.length}
records"));
```
In this example, we create a `DatabaseClient` object that connects to the MongoDB database at the specified host
and port, and then execute a query on the `myDatabaseName` database.
