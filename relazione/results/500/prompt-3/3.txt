Jolie, a statically typed and expressive programming language developed by Red Hat, provides built-in support for
connecting to various databases through its `jolie-db` package. This library enables developers to interact with
relational databases using a simple and intuitive syntax.

To establish a connection to a database, you need to import the required modules and use the `Database.connect`
function. Here's an example of connecting to a SQLite database:
```jolie
import Database = jolie.core.Database;
import SQLite3 = require('sqlite3');

// Initialize a connection pool with a maximum size of 10 connections
Database.Pool(10).connect((conn, e) => {
  if (e !== null) return throwError(e);
  // Use the connected SQLite3 instance to interact with the database
  let db = new SQLite3(conn);
  // Perform database operations here...
});
```
In this example, we first import the `Database` module and the `sqlite3` module from Node.js. We then initialize a
connection pool with a maximum size of 10 connections using the `Database.Pool` function. Finally, we create a new
SQLite3 instance with the connected connection and use it to perform database operations.

To interact with the database, you can define functions that accept a connection as an argument and return results
as needed. For example, here's a function to query the database:
```jolie
import Database = jolie.core.Database;
import SQLite3 = require('sqlite3');

function query(conn, sql) {
  let result = conn.query(sql);
  if (result !== null && result.rows !== null) {
    for (let row of result.rows) {
      // Process the result rows here...
    }
  }
  return result;
}
```
In this example, we import the `Database` and `sqlite3` modules. We define a function called `query` that takes a
connection object and a SQL statement as arguments. The `query` function returns a promise that resolves to an
object containing the result rows if the query was successful. If there are any errors during the execution of the
SQL statement, the function throws an error.

To use Jolie's database support in your application, you need to add the following dependencies to your
`package.json` file:
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "jolie": "^0.26.1",
    "sqlite3": "^3.0.4"
  }
}
```
Then, you can import the required modules and use the `Database.connect` function to establish a connection to a
database:
```jolie
import SQLite3 = require('sqlite3');
import Database = jolie.core.Database;

// Initialize a connection pool with a maximum size of 10 connections
Database.Pool(10).connect((conn, e) => {
  if (e !== null) return throwError(e);
  // Use the connected SQLite3 instance to interact with the database
  let db = new SQLite3(conn);
  // Perform database operations here...
});
```
As you can see, Jolie's database support makes it easy to interact with various relational databases using a simple
and intuitive syntax. By importing the required modules and using the `Database.connect` function, you can
establish a connection to a database and perform database operations with ease.
