Certainly! To create a simple communication channel between two Jolie programs, you can use the `jolie_stream`
library. Here's an example of how you might implement it:

1. First, create a new Jolie module for your sender program:
```jolie
module my_sender {
  import stream = jolie_core.Stream;

  function main() {
    // Initialize the sender stream
    let stream = Stream(0);
    stream.add_on_message = message => {
      // Send an "Hello World" message to the receiver
      write("Received: ", message.payload);
    };

    // Start the sender
    send(stream, "Hello World");
  }
}
```
In this example, `main()` creates a new stream and sets up an event handler that sends the response back through
the same stream. The `write()` function is used to print out the received message.

2. Next, create a new Jolie module for your receiver program:
```jolie
module my_receiver {
  import stream = jolie_core.Stream;
  import socket = jolie_core.SocketIO;

  function main() {
    // Initialize the receiver socket
    let socket = SocketIO("localhost", 1234);

    // Set up an event listener for incoming messages
    socket.on_message = message => {
      // Receive and print out the "Hello World" message from the sender
      write(message.payload, "Received: ");
    };

    // Start the receiver
    receive();
  }
}
```
In this example, `main()` initializes an event listener for incoming messages using the `on_message` event. The
socket is connected to the server on port 1234 and starts listening for incoming messages.

3. Finally, compile and run the sender program:
```sh
joliec my_sender.jolie
./my_sender
```
4. Compile and run the receiver program:
```sh
joliec my_receiver.jolie
./my_receiver
```

Now, you should be able to send an "Hello World" message from the sender program to the receiver program and
receive a response on the output stream.
