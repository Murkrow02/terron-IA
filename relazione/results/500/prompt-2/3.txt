In Jolie, a session is a mechanism that enables communication between different components or processes of a
system. It allows these components to exchange data and coordinate their actions, providing a high level of
abstraction for building concurrent and distributed applications. Sessions in Jolie are similar to communication
endpoints, enabling components to send and receive messages from other components within the same session.

Sessions can be used to create a dialogue between two or more components, allowing them to share data and
coordinate their actions. This is particularly useful for building user interfaces that involve multiple parts of
an application, such as a web application with multiple tabs or pages. By using sessions, you can ensure that
components are able to communicate effectively and maintain the state of their interactions.

A session in Jolie consists of a set of messages exchanged between its components. Each message is identified by a
unique identifier (ID) and contains data to be processed by the receiving component. Components can also use
session-scoped variables to store data that is accessible to all messages within the same session.

To create a session in Jolie, you can define a new type of process called a "session manager" or simply a
"session". This session manager will be responsible for managing the interactions between its components using the
session API. The session can be initialized with some parameters, such as a unique name or a list of participants.
Once started, components can join or leave the session by sending messages to the session manager.

Here's an example of how to create a simple session in Jolie:
```jolie
module Sessions {
    export type Session = {
        name: string;
        participants: map<string, any>;
    };

    process SessionManager {
        import Event;
        import Timeout;
        import Message;

        on Initialize() {
            emit Event.create("Session", null);
        }

        on Join(name: string) {
            // Add participant to session
            emit Message.create("Adding participant", name);
            emit Timeout.create(500ms, () => {
                if (typeof participants === "undefined") {
                    emit Event.create("Session error: participant not found");
                    return;
                }

                // Update session data
                emit Message.create("Participant has joined", name);
                emit Timeout.create(500ms, () => {
                    if (typeof participants !== "undefined") {
                        emit Event.create("Session error: participant already present");
                        return;
                    }

                    participants = true;
                });
            });

            emit Message.create("Participants map", participants);
        }

        on Leave(name: string) {
            if (typeof participants === "undefined") return;

            // Remove participant from session
            delete participants;
            emit Timeout.create(500ms, () => {
                if (typeof participants !== "undefined") {
                    emit Event.create("Session error: participant not found");
                    return;
                }

                emit Message.create("Participant has left", name);
            });
        }
    };
}
```
In this example, the `SessionManager` process is responsible for managing the interactions between participants in
a session using the `Join` and `Leave` methods. When a participant joins, it sends its name to the
`SessionManager`. If the participant is not found, an error event is emitted. If the participant is already
present, another error event is emitted. Once the participant has joined, its name is added to the `participants`
map, and a success event is emitted.

When a participant leaves, it sends its name to the `SessionManager`. The `SessionManager` then removes the
participant from the `participants` map and emits a success event if there are still participants in the session.

By using sessions, you can ensure that components in your system can communicate effectively and coordinate their
actions in a distributed and concurrent environment.
