different components within a distributed application or system.

A **process** is an instance of a program running on a single machine. It has its own memory space, file
descriptors, and resources. Processes communicate through channels, which allow them to send and receive data
without sharing their memory space directly. Channels can be either synchronous (using the `receive` or `send`
operations) or asynchronous (using message queues).

On the other hand, **sessions** are a higher-level abstraction that enables communication and coordination between
multiple processes in different machines. Sessions allow for communication with remote peers and enable the
exchange of data across processes running on different hosts. Jolie provides built-in support for session-based
communication through its `Session` type.

To elaborate further, sessions in Jolie are implemented using reliable message queues or other messaging middleware
such as RabbitMQ or Apache Kafka. These middleware ensure that messages are delivered reliably and in the correct
order, even when dealing with network-related issues like packet loss or latency. Sessions enable communication
between processes by providing a mechanism to establish and manage connections, send and receive messages, and
handle fault tolerance and recovery.

In summary, processes and sessions in Jolie are related but distinct concepts that help manage communication and
coordination within distributed systems. Processes are instances of running programs on a single machine, while
sessions enable communication between processes running on different hosts using messaging queues or other
middleware.
