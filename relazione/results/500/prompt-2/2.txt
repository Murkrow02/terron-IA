In Jolie, processes are instances of an application that can execute concurrently with other processes. They have
their own memory space and resources, allowing them to run independently without interfering with each other.
Processes are the fundamental units of execution in Jolie.

Sessions, on the other hand, represent a communication channel between two or more processes. Sessions allow
processes to exchange data and coordinate actions as if they were interacting directly with each other. They enable
process-to-process communication, making it easy to build distributed applications using Jolie.

To elaborate further, sessions in Jolie are implemented using the `session` type, which defines a connection
between two processes. Sessions can be either synchronous (blocking) or asynchronous (non-blocking). In a
synchronous session, a process sends a message to another process and waits for a response before proceeding. This
type of communication is useful for implementing producer-consumer patterns or coordinating actions between
different components of an application.

Asynchronous sessions, on the other hand, allow processes to send messages without waiting for a response. This
type of communication is ideal for building scalable and high-performance applications where real-time interaction
is not required.

In summary, while processes and sessions in Jolie share some similarities, they serve different purposes: processes
represent the independent entities that can execute concurrently, while sessions provide a communication channel
between processes to facilitate coordination and data exchange.
