Jolie is a high-level programming language that offers a convenient and expressive syntax for building concurrent
and parallel systems, including RESTful APIs. When implementing RESTful APIs in Jolie, developers can take
advantage of its built-in support for asynchronous operations, data serialization, and error handling.

Here's an example of how to create a simple GET request using Jolie:
```jolie
import http from "http/lib"

function main() {
  let req = new Request("GET", "/api/v1/users")
  async fetchData(response) {
    if (response.status == 200) {
      // Process data in the response payload
      let users = json.decode(response.payload)
      print "Number of users: ", users.length
    } else {
      print "Error: ", response.reason
    }
  }
  await fetchData(req)
}
```
In this example, we first import the `http` library from Jolie's standard library. We then create a new request
object (`Request`), specifying the HTTP method (`GET`) and the endpoint `/api/v1/users`. The `fetchData` function
is defined to handle the response payload when the GET operation completes successfully.

Jolie also provides built-in support for data serialization through its `json` package. This allows developers to
easily convert between Jolie's native types and JSON data formats. Additionally, Jolie offers features such as
automatic error handling and concurrency management to make it easier to build scalable and reliable systems.
