Jolie, or Java for Object-oriented Language and Processing, is a powerful, statically typed, general-purpose
programming language that supports multiple paradigms such as procedural, object-oriented, functional, and
concurrent programming. When it comes to handling RESTful web services or APIs, Jolie provides a simple and
convenient API for creating them using its built-in `rest` module.

In Jolie, REST APIs are defined using the `rest` keyword, which is used as a keyword in the service definition. For
instance, if you want to define a GET operation for a specific resource, you can do so by writing:
```jolie
// Define the API endpoint here
resource GetResource() {
  // Function that takes an input JSON object
  function(input: any): any {
    // Your implementation here
  }
}
```
This example defines a GET operation for a resource with the name "GetResource". The function `function(input:
any): any` accepts an input JSON object and returns any output value.

Once your service is defined, you can use it as follows:
```jolie
// Usage example here
GET /api/resources HTTP/1.1
Host: your-domain.com
