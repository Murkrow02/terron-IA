Jolie, developed by Google, is a statically typed, object-oriented programming language designed for building
efficient and maintainable systems. It has built-in support for handling RESTful APIs and can be used to define
HTTP endpoints and requests using the `rest` module.

To implement a REST API in Jolie, you first need to import the `net` and `rest` modules in your code. The `net`
module provides network-related functionality, while the `rest` module contains classes for handling HTTP endpoints
and requests.

Here is an example of how to define a RESTful API for a simple resource called "users":
```jolie
import net._TCP;
import rest._RESTServer;
import rest._HTTPEndpoint;

class UserResource extends _RESTServer {
  // Define the endpoint for the users resource
  private _usersEndpoint: _HTTPEndpoint = {
    method(GET): _RESPONSE[200]() => {
      // Retrieve a list of all users
      return [
        [1, "Alice", "alice@example.com"],
        [2, "Bob", "bob@example.com"]
      ];
    },

    method(POST): _RESPONSE[201]() => {
      // Create a new user
      let user = _User();
      user["name"] = _request["name"];
      user["email"] = _request["email"];
      return [

      ];
    }
  };
}
```
In this example, the `UserResource` is an instance of the `RESTServer` class and defines a RESTful API for a
resource called "users". The `_usersEndpoint` is an HTTP endpoint that responds to GET requests with a list of all
users and accepts POST requests with new user data.

To use this API, you can create a TCP server listening on a specific port and import the `UserResource` into your
code. Then, start the server using the `TCPServer` class:
```jolie
import net._TCP;

let app = new _TCPServer(8080, UserResource);
app.start();
```
This will create a TCP server listening on port 8080 and run the specified `UserResource` instance. Clients can
then connect to this server and interact with the API using HTTP GET or POST requests.
