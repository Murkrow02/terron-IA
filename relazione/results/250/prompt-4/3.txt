Certainly! Here's an example of how to create a simple Jolie program that sends and receives "Hello World" messages
between two processes:

Program 1 (Client):
```jolie
import com.redhat.jolie.process;
import com.redhat.jolie.system.*;

// Create a new process with the name "client"
process Client = Process.launch(ClientModule.module());

// Define a function to send a message to the other process
func sendMessage {
    // Get the address of the other process
    Address remoteAddress = Context.get("other_process_address");

    // Send the "Hello World" message to the other process
    Context.write("Hello World", remoteAddress);
}

// Define a function to receive messages from the other process
func receiveMessage {
    // Wait for a message from the other process
    Context.waitForRead("message_queue");

    // Read the message and print it out
    String receivedMessage = Context.readText();
    System.out.println(receivedMessage);
}

// Start the Client process
Client.onStart(event -> {
    // Send a "Hello World" message to the other process
    sendMessage();
});

Client.onStop(event -> {
    // Receive any messages sent by the other process before stopping the Client process
    receiveMessage();
});
```

Program 2 (Server):
```jolie
import com.redhat.jolie.process;
import com.redhat.jolie.system.*;

// Create a new process with the name "server"
process Server = Process.launch(ServerModule.module());

// Define a function to receive messages from the Client process
func receiveMessageFromClient {
    // Wait for a message from the Client process
    Context.waitForRead("message_queue");

    // Read the message and print it out
    String receivedMessage = Context.readText();
    System.out.println(receivedMessage);
}

func startServer() {
    // Start listening for messages from the Client process
    Server.sendAddress(Address("other_process_address"));
    Server.start();
}

// Start the Server process
startServer();
```

In this example, the `Client` process sends a "Hello World" message to the `Server` process using the `sendMessage`
function. The `Server` process listens for messages on the `message_queue` and prints out any received messages
using the `receiveMessageFromClient` function. To use these programs, you will need to replace
`"other_process_address"` with the address of the other process.

Here's a summary of the key steps:

1. Create a new `Client` and `Server` process using Process.launch().
2. Define functions for sending messages and receiving messages in both processes.
3. Set up the address for the other process in the `Server` process.
4. Start the `Client` process and send a "Hello World" message to the `Server` process.
5. Start the `Server` process and wait for incoming messages from the `Client` process.
6. Print out any received messages from the `Server` process.

This example demonstrates how to create a simple communication channel between two Jolie processes using the
`Address` and `Context` classes. You can further customize the code to implement more complex communication
patterns and protocols.
