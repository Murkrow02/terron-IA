Jolie, as an open-source programming language, supports the creation of RESTful APIs (Representational State
Transfer) for web services and applications. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how Jolie handles REST APIs:

1. Resource Identification: In Jolie, you identify resources and their endpoints using the `@resource` directive
and specifying the resource type. For example, if your API is for a web service, you can use the `@service`
directive along with the `@resource` to define a resource type.
```jolie
// Service definition
service MyService {
  // Resource definition
  @resource(type = "users")
  interface UsersResource extends HttpInterface {
    method GET("/users", Response<List<User>>) {}
    method PUT("/users", Request(body = Map(key = "name", value = "John Doe")), Response(400)) {}
  }
}
```
2. Method Implementation: Jolie provides a built-in library for implementing RESTful HTTP methods such as GET,
POST, PUT, DELETE, and others. For example, you can implement a `GET` method using the `@http` directive followed
by the requested HTTP method and the endpoint URL.
```jolie
// User resource implementation
// Implement GET method to get all users from an API
@http(method = "GET", url = "/users")
function getAllUsers(response: Response<List<User>>) {}
```
3. Modeling Data: Jolie allows you to define data models using its built-in `@type` directive for enums and
`@model` directive for structs (data types with fields). This enables you to model the payload and response
structures in your API.
```jolie
// Define user data type
enum User {
  JOHN(id = 1, name = "John Doe", email = "john@example.com"),
}

data UserResource = {
  @model User,
};
```
4. Request/Response Handling: Jolie provides built-in support for handling requests and responses in your API. You
can define request bodies using the `@body` directive, response status codes using the `@code` directive, and error
handling using `@error` directive.
```jolie
// Implement PUT method to update a user
@http(method = "PUT", url = "/users", body = "@model UserResource")
function putUser(request: Request(body = Map(key = "name", value = "John Doe"))) {
  // Update the user
}
```
5. Error Handling: Jolie allows you to define custom error messages using the `@error` directive for specific HTTP
methods. This enables you to handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful feedback to the client.
```jolie
// Implement PUT method to update a user with an invalid body
@http(method = "PUT", url = "/users", body = "@model UserResource")
function putUser(@error status = 400) {
  // Handle error
}
```
By using Jolie, you can create well-structured, maintainable, and performant RESTful APIs for web services and
applications.
