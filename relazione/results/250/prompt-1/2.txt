Jolie is a statically typed programming language built on top of Rust, which provides support for writing safe and
efficient concurrent programs. It offers features like first-class functions, macros, and pattern matching to build
high-level abstractions. Jolie can be used to define RESTful APIs using the `jolie-rest` library, which allows you
to create HTTP endpoints and handle requests and responses easily.

When implementing a REST API in Jolie, you first need to import the `jolie-rest` library. Here's an example of how
to create a simple GET endpoint for a resource:

```jolie
#import jolie-rest as rest

// Define a handler function
fn handler(req: &mut Request<rest::Http>, resp: Response<rest::Http>) -> Result<(), rest::Error> {
    // Handle the request here...
}

// Create a GET endpoint using the `GET` method provided by jolie-rest
rest::GET("/resource") => handler,
```

In this example, we import the `jolie-rest` library and define a handler function named `handler`. The `GET` method
is used to create a new endpoint for the `/resource` path. Inside the handler function, we handle the request and
response as needed.

Here's an example of how to handle the request:

```jolie
let url_params = req.url().query();
let name = match url_params.get("name") {
    Some(value) => value,
    None => "Unknown",
};

resp.status(200).body(name);
```

In this example, we use the `req.url().query()` method to access query parameters from the request URL. The
`resp.status()` and `resp.body()` methods are used to set the status code and body for the response, respectively.

By using Jolie and the `jolie-rest` library, you can create safe, efficient, and maintainable REST APIs with ease.
