Jolie, a statically typed, high-performance programming language developed by Red Hat and IBM Research, supports
the implementation of RESTful APIs through its built-in support for web services. Jolie provides a simple and
intuitive syntax for creating RESTful API endpoints, making it easy to define resources, methods, and parameters.

When implementing RESTful APIs in Jolie, you can use the `rest` keyword to declare a resource interface, which
contains all the methods for interacting with that resource. For example:
```jolie
import web
import rest

resource MyResource {
  method GET : Response<string> {
    return "Hello World!"
  }
}
```
In this example, we define a `MyResource` interface with a GET method that returns a string. This is a simple
RESTful API endpoint for the `MyResource` resource.

Jolie also provides built-in support for handling HTTP requests and responses using its `http` library. You can use
this library to implement more advanced features like authentication, rate limiting, and caching. Here's an example
of how to handle a GET request with basic authentication:
```jolie
import http
import web

resource MyResource {
  method GET : Response<string> {
    on Request {
      if (request.auth != "Basic " && request.auth != "Bearer ") {
        return Failure("Invalid authentication")
      }

      return "Hello World!"
    }
  }
}
```
In this example, we add an authorization check to the GET method using the `http` library's `on Request` event. We
require a basic or bearer token for access. Jolie also supports JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication.

To implement rate limiting and caching, you can use additional libraries like `jolie-rate-limiting` and
`jolie-caching`. These libraries provide built-in support for implementing various rate limiting strategies and
caching policies.

In summary, Jolie simplifies the process of implementing RESTful APIs by providing a simple and intuitive syntax
for defining resources and methods, built-in support for web services and HTTP requests/responses, and additional
libraries for advanced features like authentication, rate limiting, and caching.
