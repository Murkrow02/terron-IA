Jolie, Red Hat's AI Assistant, establishes database connections using the `database` module. This module provides a
simple API for creating, querying, and managing databases. To create a connection, you need to specify the database
type, the URL of your database server, and any necessary credentials (e.g., username and password).

Here are some practical examples of using Jolie for database connections:
1. **Connecting to SQLite3**
```python
from jolie import database as db

conn = db.connect("sqlite:///example.db", "user", "password")

print("Connected to SQLite3")
```
2. **Connecting to PostgreSQL**
```python
import psycopg2
from jolie import database as db

conn = db.connect("postgresql://user:password@localhost/example", "example")

print("Connected to PostgreSQL")
