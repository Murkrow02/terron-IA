In Jolie, processes are the main execution units that can communicate with each other using various channels. They
represent individual tasks or components that run independently within a system. A process typically consists of a
stack of operations (instructions) and memory used by the running code. Processes can interact with each other
through channel interfaces, which enable safe and efficient communication without the need for explicit
synchronization.

Sessions in Jolie are a special type of communication mechanism between processes. They allow multiple processes to
engage in a coordinated interaction, similar to a conversation or dialogue. Sessions provide a more structured and
controlled way of exchanging data and information between processes. This is useful for implementing complex
systems that require coordination and synchronization among multiple components or tasks.

In Jolie, sessions are defined using the `session` keyword in the process definition. Each session has its own
unique identifier and can be used to exchange messages and data with other processes participating in the session.
The communication within a session follows a specific pattern, typically involving sending requests and receiving
responses from the partner process.

To further elaborate on sessions, they provide an abstraction layer for managing inter-process communication (IPC).
Instead of dealing with raw sockets or other low-level IPC mechanisms, Jolie allows developers to define sessions
and use them for exchanging data between processes. This simplifies the development process and makes it easier to
reason about the behavior of complex systems.

Sessions can be used to implement various types of communication patterns, such as request/response,
publish/subscribe, or message queuing. Additionally, Jolie provides built-in support for session persistence,
ensuring that sessions remain available even in the event of process failures or crashes.
