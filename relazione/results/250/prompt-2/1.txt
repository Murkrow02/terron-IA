In Jolie, both `Process` and `Session` are abstractions that represent separate instances of your application
running concurrently or independently. However, they differ in their functionality and use cases:

1. **Processes:** A `Process` is an independent instance of your application, running in its own address space with
its own system libraries and resources. It can interact with other processes through communication channels, but it
does not share the same memory space or have direct access to system resources outside of its own environment.
Processes are useful for isolating specific parts of your application and ensuring they do not interfere with each
other's state or behavior.

2. **Sessions:** A `Session` is a shared context between related processes, allowing them to communicate and
synchronize their actions in real-time. Sessions provide an abstraction layer that enables multiple processes to
interact as if they were part of the same conversation, without needing to share memory or resources directly. This
makes sessions particularly useful when dealing with complex applications that require coordinated behavior across
different components.

To elaborate on `sessions`, a session is an entity that manages communication between related processes. It
provides a simple and efficient way to send and receive messages, ensuring proper order and delivery. Sessions can
be used for various purposes, such as passing data between services, coordinating actions in distributed systems,
or implementing concurrency control mechanisms.

In Jolie, sessions are implemented using the `Session` type, which defines a set of operations that can be
performed on the session, such as sending messages, receiving responses, and managing session state. By using
sessions, developers can create more modular and scalable applications that can easily adapt to changing
requirements or architectural patterns.
