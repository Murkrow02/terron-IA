In Jolie, a language for describing and generating distributed systems, processes are units of execution that run
independently and concurrently. They represent individual tasks or services within a system, each with its own
memory space, resources, and lifecycle. Processes communicate with each other through messages passed across
channels, allowing them to coordinate their actions and synchronize their states.

Sessions in Jolie are an abstraction that enables secure and efficient communication between processes. Sessions
are like virtual communication endpoints, enabling multiple processes to engage in a dialogue while maintaining
privacy and data integrity. By using sessions, developers can create well-defined interfaces for services, making
it easier to design modular and scalable systems.

In Jolie, sessions are implemented using the `io.jolie.runtime.Session` class. This class provides methods for
creating, managing, and joining sessions between processes. Sessions can be used to define clear boundaries for
communication, ensuring that data is only accessible within a specific process or set of processes.

To better understand the concept of sessions in Jolie, let's consider a simple example. Suppose you have two
services: an API server and a database manager. Both services need to communicate with each other to perform their
tasks, but they should remain isolated from one another to ensure data consistency and security.

To implement this, you can create separate processes for the API server and the database manager, and define
sessions between them. By doing so, you can define clear boundaries for communication, ensuring that data is only
accessible within a specific process or set of processes. Additionally, you can use encryption and authentication
mechanisms to secure the communication channel and prevent unauthorized access.

In summary, sessions in Jolie are an essential abstraction that enables secure and efficient communication between
processes. They allow developers to create well-defined interfaces for services while maintaining privacy and data
integrity. By using sessions, developers can build modular, scalable, and resilient distributed systems.
