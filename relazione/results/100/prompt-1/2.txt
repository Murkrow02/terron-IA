Jolie is a statically typed language for building distributed applications with excellent support for RESTful APIs.
It simplifies the process of creating APIs by offering built-in features for handling HTTP requests and responses,
making it easy to create web services or integrate your application with existing ones.

In Jolie, you can define endpoints for handling different API methods using the `service` statement. This service
acts as an entry point for clients to interact with your application through its defined endpoints.

Here's an example of how you could use Jolie to define a simple RESTful API for managing books:

```jolie
// Define a book service
service BookService {
  // Method to create a new book
  operation postBook(
    string name,
    integer authorId = null,
    date publishedDate = null
  ) returns Book {
    // Implement the logic for creating a new book here
  }

  // Method to get all books by an author
  operation getAllBooksByAuthor(
    int authorId
  ) returns [Book] {
    // Implement the logic for retrieving books by an author here
  }
}
```

In this example, we have a `BookService` that exposes two methods: one to create a new book and another to get all
books by an author. The `operation` keyword is used to define each method, and the `returns` clause specifies the
data type of the response (a `Book` in this case).

To implement the API endpoints, you can use the built-in `http` module that comes with Jolie. This allows you to
send HTTP requests using the `send` method and receive responses using the `receive` method.

For instance, to create a new book, you could use the following code:

```jolie
// Implementation for postBook method
import http = require("http");
import BookService = require("./BookService");

BookService.postBook(
  "My Awesome Book",
  authorId,
  publishedDate
).send().receive((result: Book) => {
  console.log("New book created with ID:", result.id);
});
```

This code sends an HTTP POST request to the `/books` endpoint defined in the `BookService`, passing in the name of
the book, the author's ID, and the publication date as JSON payload. The `receive` method is used to handle the
response from the server, which should return a new `Book` object with an ID.

Similarly, to get all books by an author, you could use:

```jolie
// Implementation for getAllBooksByAuthor method
import http = require("http");
import BookService = require("./BookService");

BookService.getAllBooksByAuthor(authorId).send().receive((results: [Book]) => {
  console.log("List of books by author", results);
});
```

This code sends an HTTP GET request to the `/books` endpoint, passing in the author ID as a query parameter. The
`receive` method is used again to handle the response from the server, which should return a list of books by the
specified author.

By using Jolie and its built-in support for RESTful APIs, you can create powerful distributed applications that
integrate seamlessly with existing web services or other systems.
