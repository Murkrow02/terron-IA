Jolie, an open-source web development framework, supports various databases through its built-in database drivers.
These drivers enable developers to interact with different types of databases, such as SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL,
and Oracle. In this answer, I will explain how Jolie handles database connections and provide some practical
examples.

Jolie uses a connection pooling mechanism to manage database connections efficiently. Connection pooling is a
technique that allows the framework to reuse existing connections instead of creating new ones for each request.
This strategy reduces overhead and improves performance by minimizing the time spent on establishing and tearing
down connections.

To use Jolie for database operations, you first need to install the appropriate database driver package. For
SQLite, the package name is `jolie-sqlite`. After installing the package, you can import it into your Jolie
application:
```
import sqlite3 from 'sqlite3'
```
Once the SQLite driver is imported, you can create a connection pool and establish a connection to the SQLite
database using the following code snippet:
```jolie
let pool = new ConnectionPool {
  name: "sqlite",
  url: "sqlite:///database.db",
  driver: sqlite3
}

ConnectionPool.with(pool) {
  useConnection(() => {
    // Use the SQLite connection here
    const query = 'SELECT * FROM table_name';
    const result = SQLite.query(query);
  });
}
```
In this example, you created a connection pool with a name `sqlite` and an URL pointing to the SQLite database file
`database.db`. The `useConnection` function is used to establish a connection to the SQLite database when the
connection pool is exhausted or when a new connection is required.

To perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the SQLite database, you can use the `SQLite` class
provided by Jolie:
```jolie
// Create a new row in the table
SQLite.execute("INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2) VALUES (:value1, :value2)")
  .then(() => {
    // The new row has been inserted successfully
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // Handle the error
  });

// Read all rows from the table
SQLite.query("SELECT * FROM table_name")
  .then(result => {
    // Iterate through the result set and print each row
    result.forEach((row) => {
      console.log(`Row: ${row}`);
    });
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // Handle the error
  });

// Update a specific row in the table
SQLite.execute("UPDATE table_name SET column1 = :value1, column2 = :value2 WHERE id = :id")
  .then(() => {
    // The update has been applied successfully
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // Handle the error
  });

// Delete a specific row from the table
SQLite.execute("DELETE FROM table_name WHERE id = :id")
  .then(() => {
    // The row has been deleted successfully
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // Handle the error
  });
```
In summary, Jolie handles database connections using a connection pooling mechanism, which allows developers to
reuse existing connections and improve performance. To interact with different databases, you need to install the
appropriate driver package and use the built-in `SQLite` class provided by Jolie for CRUD operations.
