Jolie, a modern open-source web framework for developing user interfaces, supports database connections using the
`database` module. This module provides various connection types and classes to manage interactions with different
databases. In this answer, I will explain how Jolie handles database connections and provide practical examples to
demonstrate their usage.

### Database Connection Types in Jolie

Jolie supports several connection types for different databases, including:

- SQLite
- PostgreSQL
- MySQL
- MariaDB

To use a specific database connection type, you can import the corresponding class from the `database` module. For
example, to connect to a PostgreSQL database, you can import the `PostgreSQL` class as follows:
```jolie
from jolie.database import PostgreSQL
```
### Establishing a Database Connection

To establish a connection to a database using Jolie, you need to create an instance of the desired connection type
and configure its properties. Here's an example for a SQLite database:
```jolie
import SQLite

class SQLiteConnection(SQLite):
    @init()
    def __init__(self, database_file):
        self.database_file = database_file
```
To connect to a PostgreSQL database, you would use the `PostgreSQL` class as follows:
```jolie
import PostgreSQL

class PostgreSQLConnection(PostgreSQL):
    @init()
    def __init__(self, database_host, database_name, database_user, database_password):
        self.database_host = database_host
        self.database_name = database_name
        self.database_user = database_user
        self.database_password = database_password
```
### Database Connection Properties

When creating a connection instance, you can configure various properties such as the database file or connection
URL for SQLite and PostgreSQL, respectively. For SQLite, you can specify the database file as follows:
```jolie
sqliteConnection = SQLiteConnection(database_file="mydatabase.db")
```
For PostgreSQL, you can specify the connection URL, host, name, user, and password as follows:
```jolie
postgresqlConnection = PostgreSQLConnection("host=localhost dbname=mydatabase user=postgres password=secret")
```
### Performing Database Operations

Once you have established a database connection, you can perform various database operations using the `Database`
class provided by Jolie. For example, to execute a SQL query in SQLite:
```jolie
sqliteConnection = SQLiteConnection("database_file=mydatabase.db")
query = "SELECT * FROM mytable"
print(sqliteConnection.execute(query))
```
For PostgreSQL, you can execute SQL queries using the `postgres` class provided by Jolie:
```jolie
postgresqlConnection = PostgreSQLConnection("host=localhost dbname=mydatabase user=postgres password=secret")
query = "SELECT * FROM mytable"
print(postgresConnection.execute(query))
```
### Conclusion

In summary, Jolie handles database connections using the `database` module, which provides various connection types
and classes to manage interactions with different databases. By establishing a connection instance and configuring
its properties, you can perform various database operations in Jolie. The examples provided above demonstrate how
to use SQLite and PostgreSQL connections to execute SQL queries.
