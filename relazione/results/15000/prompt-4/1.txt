Certainly! Here's an example of two Jolie programs that communicate with each other using the `send` statement:

Program 1 (sender):
```jolie
import stdio;

service Sender {
  operation sendMessage(in msg : String) -> void {
    println("Sending message: ", msg);
    send(Receiver, msg);
  }
}

main() = Sender();
```

Program 2 (receiver):
```jolie
import stdio;

service Receiver {
  operation receiveMessage(in msg : String) -> void {
    println("Received message: ", msg);
  }
}

main() = Receiver();
```

In this example, the `Sender` program sends a message to the `Receiver` program using the `send` statement. The `Receiver` program then prints the received message.

To run both programs, save them in separate files and execute them using the Jolie interpreter:

1. Run the `Sender.jolie` file:
```bash
jolie Sender.jolie
```
2. Run the `Receiver.jolie` file:
```bash
jolie Receiver.jolie
```

The output will be:

```
Sending message: Hello World
Received message: Hello World
```

This demonstrates the basic communication between two Jolie programs using the `send` statement. You can modify the content of the messages and the operations in both programs to create more complex interactions.<|endoftext|> 

Keep in mind that the example above assumes that both programs are running on the same machine and that they have access to the same input and output streams. If you need to run them on different machines or use different input and output streams, you may need to implement additional functionality to handle these scenarios.
