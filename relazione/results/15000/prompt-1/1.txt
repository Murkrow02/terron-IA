Jolie is a service-oriented programming language that supports the implementation of RESTful APIs through its built-in support for HTTP protocol. When designing a REST API in Jolie, you can define operations using the `operation` keyword and specify their input and output parameters using the `param` keyword.

Here's an example of how to define a simple GET operation for a resource named "users":

```jolie
service UsersService {
  operation getUsers() returns (users: List<User>) {
    // Implementation of the GET operation here
  }
}
```

In this example, the `getUsers` operation returns a list of `User` objects. The implementation of the operation is left blank for demonstration purposes. You can add the necessary logic to retrieve and return the data from a database or other external sources.

When a client sends an HTTP request to the server with the `GET` method and the URL "/users", Jolie will execute the `getUsers` operation and return the response to the client. The response will be in the format of a JSON object, as defined by the RESTful API specification.

For more complex operations, you can use Jolie's support for various data types and message passing between services. Additionally, Jolie provides built-in support for error handling and security features, making it a powerful choice for building scalable and secure RESTful APIs.
