Jolie, as a service-oriented programming language, supports database connections through its built-in database module. This module allows developers to interact with various databases, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite, using SQL statements.

To establish a connection to a database, you need to define a database service and provide its connection details in the `connection` field of the service definition. Here's an example for SQLite:

```jolie
service SQLiteDatabase {
  connection {
    url = "sqlite:///database.db";
    driver = "org.sqlite.JDBC";
    user = "username";
    password = "password";
  }

  operation query(string query) returns (string result) {
    // Your query here
  }
}
```

Once the connection is established, you can use the `query` operation to execute SQL statements and retrieve results. Here's an example of how to query a table:

```jolie
service SQLiteDatabase {
  connection {
    url = "sqlite:///database.db";
    driver = "org.sqlite.JDBC";
    user = "username";
    password = "password";
  }

  operation query(string query) returns (string result) {
    // Your query here
  }

  operation insert(string name, string email) {
    query = "INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES (?, ?);";
    result = query(name + " " + email);
  }
}
```

In this example, the `insert` operation is defined to insert a new user into the `users` table. The `query` operation is used to execute the SQL statement and return the result.

To use the database connection in your Jolie services, you need to import the database module and use the `Database` class to create a new instance of the database service. Here's an example:

```jolie
import database;

service Main {
  operation main() {
    let db = new Database("sqlite:///database.db");
    let userService = new SQLiteDatabase("sqlite:///database.db");

    // Use the database connection to interact with the database
    // ...
  }
}
```

In this example, the `Database` class is imported and a new instance of the `SQLiteDatabase` service is created using the connection details provided in the `connection` field of the service definition. The `main` operation initializes the database connection and creates an instance of the `SQLiteDatabase` service. You can then use this instance to interact with the database as needed.

By using Jolie's built-in database module, you can easily establish and manage database connections in your service-oriented applications. The module provides a convenient way to interact with various databases using SQL statements, making it an essential tool for building robust and scalable applications.<|endoftext|>
