On the other hand, in a request-response pattern, the client sends a message to the service and waits for a response. In Jolie, these patterns are implemented using asynchronous and synchronous communication respectively.\n\nAs for defining custom error messages using WebServicesUtils in Jolie, you can create a new exception type that extends `ExceptionType` and define its fields accordingly. Here's an example:\n\n```jolie\nmodule MyModule {\n  import webservices as ws;\n\n  define CustomError =\n    exception ExceptionName with { message : String };\n\n  interface MyInterface {\n    operation OperationName() returns (ResultType) {\n      handle ws:RequestMessage(request : RequestType) -> {\n        try {\n          \/\/ Your implementation here\n        } catch (error as CustomError) {\n          let response = ws:Fault(faultCode := \"CustomError\", faultString := error.message);\n          return response;\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```","role":"assistant"}]}
