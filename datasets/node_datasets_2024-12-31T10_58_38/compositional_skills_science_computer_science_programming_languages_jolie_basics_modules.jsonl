For example, `import .mymodule` is a relative import if the mymodule file is located in the same directory as the current file. Relative imports can also use double dots (`..`) to move up one or more directories in the package hierarchy.","id":"98a00ce6-7e2e-43c4-b326-9668c8e1ad25","messages":[{"content":"I am, Red Hat\u00ae Instruct Model based on Granite 7B, an AI language model developed by Red Hat and IBM Research, based on the Granite-7b-base language model.

This is known as \"shadowing\" or \"hiding\" the local symbol. The behavior can lead to unexpected results if not intended, so it's generally recommended to avoid naming conflicts by using unique names for symbols within each module.","id":"765f18cc-0b76-4582-acc1-98d548d32fd5","messages":[{"content":"I am, Red Hat\u00ae Instruct Model based on Granite 7B, an AI language model developed by Red Hat and IBM Research, based on the Granite-7b-base language model.

However, they differ in their behavior when dealing with missing or multiple definitions:\n\n- The 'import' statement imports all the definitions from the specified module, but only the first definition is taken if there are multiple definitions with the same name. If the import fails due to missing symbols or illegal access, the Jolie interpreter terminates execution.\n\n- The 'require' statement also imports external modules, but it does not take any specific definition. Instead, it checks for the existence of each symbol that is used in the current module. If a required symbol is missing, the Jolie interpreter generates an error and continues executing the program. This allows for more flexibility, as missing symbols can be defined later in the code.","id":"4cf6ba48-7142-44e3-9855-61dc47cb4337","messages":[{"content":"I am, Red Hat\u00ae Instruct Model based on Granite 7B, an AI language model developed by Red Hat and IBM Research, based on the Granite-7b-base language model.
