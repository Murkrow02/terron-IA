You can replace it with other formats like `KeyValueTextFormat`, `SequenceFileTextKeyValueFormat`, etc., depending on your use case.

To read or write compressed files using FileInterface, you need to use a library that provides support for the specific compression format. For example, for handling zip files, you can use the `sbt-zip` plugin in Scala or the `java.util.zip` package in Java. Here's an example of how to read a zip file using sbt-zip:\n\n[Start of Code]\nimport sbt.io.File\nimport sbt.io.file\n\nval zipFile = file(\"path\/to\/your\/zipfile.zip\")\nval unzippedDirectory = file(\"path\/to\/destination\/directory\")\n\nFile.using(zipFile) { zip =>\n  zip #> unzippedDirectory\n}\n[End of Code]\n\nFor handling tar files, you can use the `scala-ts-tar` library in Scala or the `java.util.tar.TarInputStream` and `java.io.FileOutputStream` in Java.","role":"assistant"}]}

For example, if you want to handle the `FileNotFound` exception, you can do it as follows:\n```jolie\nmodule Main\nimport FileInterface\nimport Exception\n\ninstall (Exception =>\n  case $e of {\n    FileNotFound => println(\"File not found.\");\n    _ => throw $e; \/\/ re-throw other exceptions\n  }\n)\n\nmain procedure() =\n  let file = open \"example.txt\" for reading;\n  \/\/ your code here\n  close file;\nend\n```\nIn the example above, we define a handler for all exceptions using the wildcard `_`. However, if you only want to handle specific exceptions, replace the wildcard with the exception name. In this case, we handle the `FileNotFound` exception by printing an error message and continuing execution. For other exceptions, we re-throw them so they can be handled elsewhere in the code.","id":"c8db035e-47c2-4a8e-9dc4-43cf2c53b921","messages":[{"content":"I am, Red Hat\u00ae Instruct Model based on Granite 7B, an AI language model developed by Red Hat and IBM Research, based on the Granite-7b-base language model.
