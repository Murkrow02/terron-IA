In Jolie, a compensation handler is defined as a function that gets called when an operation completes or fails. Here's an example of how to define and use a compensation handler in Jolio:\n\n```jolie\ninterface BankAccount {\n  operation deposit(amount: int) -> void;\n  operation withdraw(amount: int) -> void;\n}\n\ncomponent Bank {\n  private account: BankAccount = new BankAccount();\n\n  operation depositCompensatable(amount: int) -> void {\n    account.deposit(amount);\n    compensation_handler depositCompensationHandler() = if (isError()) then account.withdraw(amount);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `Bank` component has a `depositCompensatable` operation that performs a deposit and also defines a compensation handler for it. If an error occurs during the execution of the `deposit` operation, the compensation handler will be invoked to perform a withdrawal of the same amount.","role":"assistant"}]}

In Jolie, when a compensation handler is defined for a service operation, it is guaranteed that only one execution of the handler will be invoked per request-response pair, even if multiple messages are exchanged between the client and the server due to retries or errors. The `send` primitive in Jolie sends a message asynchronously without waiting for a reply, while the `reply` primitive is used to send a response synchronously after processing a request. Since compensation handlers are only invoked when an error occurs during the execution of a service operation, and since they can only be executed once per request-response pair, Jolie ensures that compensation actions are idempotent.","role":"assistant"}]}
