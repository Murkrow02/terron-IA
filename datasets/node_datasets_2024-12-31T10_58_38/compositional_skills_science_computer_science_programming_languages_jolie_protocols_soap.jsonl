XML-RPC, on the other hand, uses a simpler messaging format that consists of an XML-encoded request and response. The communication is done using HTTP as the transport protocol. XML-RPC is suitable for simple remote procedure calls where the focus is on simplicity and lightweight communication.\n\nIn Jolie, you can implement both SOAP and XML-RPC services by defining the appropriate ports and interfaces. For example:\n\n[Start of Example]\n\/\/ SOAP service definition\ninputPort MySOAPInput {\n    Location: \"http:\/\/localhost:8000\/MyService\"\n    Protocol: soap\n    Interfaces: MySOAPInterface\n}\n\ninterface MySOAPInterface {\n    operation Operation1() returns (int result) { ... }\n}\n\n\/\/ XML-RPC service definition\ninputPort MyXMLRPCIInput {\n    Location: \"http:\/\/localhost:8000\/MyService\"\n    Protocol: xmlrpc\n    Interfaces: MyXMLRPCInterface\n}\n\ninterface MyXMLRPCInterface {\n    operation Operation1(int arg) returns (int result) { ... }\n}\n[End of Example]","role":"assistant"}]}

Here are the general steps to define a SOAP message router in Jolie:\n\n1. Define the input and output interfaces for your service using the `interface` keyword. These interfaces should include the expected SOAP messages as input and output parameters. For example:\n\n```jolie\ninterface Input {\n  soapMessage: SOAPMessage\n}\n\ninterface Output {\n  response: SOAPMessage\n}\n```\n\n2. Define a new service that extends the `soap::router` class, which provides basic SOAP message routing functionality. This service should implement the input and output interfaces defined in step 1. For example:\n\n```jolie\nservice MyRouter extends soap::router {\n  interface Input\n  interface Output\n\n  function handleRequest(request: Input): Output {\n    \/\/ Implement your routing logic here\n  }\n}\n```\n\n3. In the `handleRequest` function, implement the logic to route the incoming SOAP message to the appropriate handler based on the message's operation name or WSDL definition. You can use Jolie's built-in `soap::getOperationName` and `soap::getServiceName` functions to extract this information from the SOAP message. For example:\n\n```jolie\nservice MyRouter extends soap::router {\n  interface Input\n  interface Output\n\n  function handleRequest(request: Input): Output {\n    let operationName = soap::getOperationName(request.soapMessage)\n    let serviceName = soap::getServiceName(request.soapMessage)\n\n    switch (operationName) {\n      case \"myOperation\" -> {\n        \/\/ Call the handler for myOperation here\n        let result = MyHandler.handleRequest(request.soapMessage)\n        return Output(response: result)\n      }\n      default -> {\n        \/\/ Handle other operations or errors here\n        return Output(response: SOAPMessage(\"Error: Unknown operation\"))\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n4.
