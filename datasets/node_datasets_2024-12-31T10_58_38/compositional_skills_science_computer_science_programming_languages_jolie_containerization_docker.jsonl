Start a single container of the new version with the same network and port bindings.\n4. Monitor the new container's logs to ensure it is functioning correctly.\n5. Once you are confident that the new container is working, remove one instance of the old container from the load balancer or reverse proxy.\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 for each container until all instances have been updated.\n\nTo ensure zero-downtime during this process, you can use a load balancer or reverse proxy to distribute traffic between containers.

One popular option is Prometheus, an open-source monitoring system. Here's how to set it up:\n\n1. Install Docker Compose on your host machine if not already installed.\n2. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file in the same directory as your Jolie service code with the following content:\n\n```yaml\nversion: '3'\nservices:\n  jolie:\n    build: .\n    ports:\n      - \"8080:8080\"\n    volumes:\n      - \".\/data:\/data\"\n    command: [\"jolie\", \"--logfile=\/dev\/stdout\"]\n    container_name: jolie\n  prometheus:\n    image: prom\/prometheus:v2.31.0\n    ports:\n      - \"9090:9090\"\n    volumes:\n      - \".\/prometheus.yml:\/etc\/prometheus\/prometheus.yml\"\n      - \".\/prometheus:\/prometheus\"\n    depends_on:\n      - jolie\n    command: [\"prometheus\", \"--config.file=\/etc\/prometheus\/prometheus.yml\"]\n```\n\n3. Create a `prometheus.yml` file in the same directory as your Jolie service code with the following content:\n\n```yaml\nglobal:\n  scrape_interval:     15s\n  evaluation_interval: 1m\n\nscrape_configs:\n  - job_name: 'jolie'\n    static_configs:\n      - targets: ['localhost:8080']\n```\n\n4. Run `docker-compose up -d`. This command starts both the Jolie service and Prometheus in separate containers, configures them to communicate with each other, and sets up monitoring.\n5. Access the Prometheus web interface at `http:\/\/localhost:9090` to view performance metrics for your Jolie microservice.","role":"assistant"}]}

Logging and monitoring: Implement logging and monitoring to keep track of errors and exceptions in your microservice. This can help you identify patterns, diagnose issues, and improve the overall reliability of your Docker container.","role":"assistant"}]}

It provides an isolated environment where you can package your Jolie microservices with their dependencies and run them consistently across different environments.\n2. **Jolie Docker Image**: The official Jolie Docker image (`jolieio\/jolie`) is available on Docker Hub, which includes the Jolie runtime and some common libraries. You can use this image as a base for your own Dockerfile to build custom Jolie microservices.\n3. **Docker Compose**: Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. It allows you to define the services, networks, and volumes in a YAML file, making it easier to manage multiple containers as a single application. You can use Docker Compose to start, stop, and scale your Jolie microservices.\n4. **Jolie Monitoring Tools**: Jolie provides several monitoring tools like `jolie-stats` and `jolie-logviewer`. These tools help you monitor the performance and logs of your Jolie microservices in real-time. You can use these tools to check the CPU, memory usage, network traffic, and other metrics of your containers.\n5. **Docker Swarm**: Docker Swarm is a native clustering and scheduling tool for Docker. It allows you to create and manage a swarm of Docker nodes as a single entity. You can use Docker Swarm to deploy, scale, and manage your Jolie microservices across multiple nodes.\n6. **Jolie Community**: The Jolie community provides various resources like documentation, tutorials, and examples on their website (https:\/\/jolie-lang.org\/).

In a Docker environment, you can create networks that allow containers to connect and exchange information.\n\nTo set up networking for Jolie microservices, you can use one of the following methods:\n\n1. Bridge network: This is the default network mode when you run a container without explicitly creating a network. Each container in this network can communicate with other containers on the same bridge network and with the host machine. However, they cannot directly communicate with containers on other networks.\n\n2. Overlay network: An overlay network allows you to create a virtual network that spans multiple Docker hosts. This is useful when deploying microservices across multiple machines. Containers in an overlay network can communicate with each other as if they were on the same physical network, even if they are running on different hosts.\n\n3. Macvlan network: A macvlan network assigns a unique MAC address to each container, making it appear as a separate virtual machine on the network. This is useful when you need to expose microservices using their own IP addresses.\n\nTo connect Jolie microservices in Docker using these networks, you can define the network type in the `docker run` command or in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

With Jolie Swarm, you can define your microservices as Jolie scripts, and use the `deploy` statement to deploy them on a Swarm cluster.","role":"assistant"}]}

Here are the steps:\n\n1. Build your Jolie microservice as a Docker image.\n2. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file to define the service and its dependencies, such as any databases or external services.\n3. Use the `replicated` mode in the `docker-compose.yml` file to ensure multiple instances of your microservice are running. For example:\n\n```yaml\nversion: '3'\nservices:\n  my_microservice:\n    image: my_image:latest\n    deploy:\n      replicas: 3\n      placement:\n        constraints:\n          - node.role == worker\n```\n\n4.
