Here are the steps:\n\n1. Export the WSDL file from your Jolie service: You can generate a WSDL file by using the `--generate-wsdl` flag when starting the Jolie runtime or by manually creating it using the Jolie language. For example, you can create a WSDL file for a simple calculator service as follows:\n```jolie\nservice SimpleCalculator {\n    inputPort CalculatorInputPort {\n        protocol: soap\n    }\n\n    outputPort CalculatorOutputPort {\n        protocol: soap\n    }\n\n    function main() = {\n        while (true) {\n            let request := receive\n            let result := calculate(request.a, request.b)\n            send(result, to: CalculatorOutputPort)\n        }\n    }\n\n    function calculate(a: int, b: int): int = a + b\n}\n\nexport WSDL SimpleCalculatorService as \"SimpleCalculatorService.wsdl\"\n```\nSave this Jolie code in a file named `simple_calculator.jolie`, and then run the following command to generate the WSDL file:\n```\njolie --generate-wsdl simple_calculator.jolie > SimpleCalculatorService.wsdl\n```\n\n2. Import the WSDL file into SoapUI: Open SoapUI and click on \"File\" -> \"Import\" -> \"WSDL File\". Navigate to the location of your `SimpleCalculatorService.wsdl` file and import it.\n3. Create a new test project in SoapUI: After importing the WSDL file, create a new test project by clicking on \"File\" -> \"New SOAP Project\". Name the project and click \"OK\".\n4. Define the request and response messages: In the new test project, define the request and response messages based on the WSDL file. You can do this by right-clicking on the request or response message in the tree view and selecting \"Create Request\" or \"Create Response\", respectively.\n5. Create a test case: Right-click on the test project and create a new test case. Define the test steps, such as sending a request and checking the expected response.\n6. Run the test case: Click on the play button to run the test case. SoapUI will send the request to your Jolie service and display the response.

Here's a step-by-step guide:\n\n1. Define the custom SOAP extension in an XSD file. For example, let's create a custom extension named \"MyExtension\" with an element called \"myElement\":\n\n```xml\n<xs:schema xmlns:xs=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2001\/XMLSchema\" targetNamespace=\"http:\/\/example.com\/MyExtension\">\n  <xs:element name=\"myElement\" type=\"xs:string\"\/>\n<\/xs:schema>\n```\n\n2. Include the XSD file in your WSDL by adding an import statement:\n\n```xml\n<wsdl:definitions xmlns:soap=\"http:\/\/schemas.xmlsoap.org\/wsdl\/soap\/\" xmlns:tns=\"http:\/\/example.com\/MyService\" xmlns:xsd=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2001\/XMLSchema\" targetNamespace=\"http:\/\/example.com\/MyService\" xmlns:wsdl=\"http:\/\/schemas.xmlsoap.org\/wsdl\/\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/schemas.xmlsoap.org\/wsdl\/\">\n  <wsdl:types>\n    <xsd:schema targetNamespace=\"http:\/\/example.com\/MyExtension\" xmlns:xs=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2001\/XMLSchema\" xmlns:xsi=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2001\/XMLSchema-instance\">\n      <xsd:import schemaLocation=\"MyExtension.xsd\"\/>\n    <\/xsd:schema>\n  <\/wsdl:types>\n  ...\n<\/wsdl:definitions>\n```\n\n3. Define the SOAP binding for your custom extension in the WSDL file:\n\n```xml\n<wsdl:binding name=\"MyBinding\" type=\"tns:MyPortType\">\n  <soap:binding style=\"document\" transport=\"http:\/\/schemas.xmlsoap.org\/soap\/http\"\/>\n  ...\n  <soap:extension bindingUse=\"required\" namespace=\"http:\/\/example.com\/MyExtension\" name=\"MyExtension\">\n    <soap:body use=\"literal\">\n      <xs:element name=\"myElement\" type=\"xs:string\" minOccurs=\"0\" maxOccurs=\"1\"\/>\n    <\/soap:body>\n  <\/soap:extension>\n<\/wsdl:binding>\n```\n\n4. Use the custom SOAP extension in your Jolie service definition by referencing it in the port definition:\n\n```jolie\noutputPort MyOutputPortSOAP {\n    location: \"http:\/\/localhost:8001\/MyService\"\n    protocol: soap {\n        wsdl = \"MyService.wsdl\",\n        binding = \"MyBinding\"\n    }\n}\n```","role":"assistant"}]}

It specifies the location and protocol details for sending and receiving SOAP messages.

To configure this, you need to define the policy in an XML file and reference it in your Jolie service definition. Here's an example:\n```jolie\nservice PolicyExampleService {\n    execution: concurrent\n    inputPort PolicyExamplePortSOAP {\n        location: \"socket:\/\/localhost:8002\"\n        protocol: soap {\n            wsdl = \"PolicyExampleService.wsdl\",\n            wsdl.port = \"PolicyExamplePortSOAP\"\n            policy = \"PolicyExample.xml\"\n        }\n        interfaces: PolicyExampleInterface\n    }\n    main {\n        \/\/ Service logic here\n    }\n}\n```\nIn the `PolicyExample.xml` file, define your WS-Policy as needed. For example:\n```xml\n<definitions xmlns=\"http:\/\/schemas.xmlsoap.org\/wsdl\/policy\/\"\n             xmlns:tns=\"http:\/\/example.com\/PolicyExampleService\"\n             targetNamespace=\"http:\/\/example.com\/PolicyExampleService\"\n             xmlns:wsse=\"http:\/\/docs.oasis-open.org\/wss\/2004\/01\/oasis-200401-wss-wssecurity-secext-1.0.xsd\">\n    <policy name=\"PolicyExample\">\n        <all>\n            <tns:CustomPolicy>\n                <!-- Custom policy statements here -->\n            <\/tns:CustomPolicy>\n        <\/all>\n    <\/policy>\n<\/definitions>\n```\nReplace `<tns:CustomPolicy>` with your custom policy statements.","role":"assistant"}]}
