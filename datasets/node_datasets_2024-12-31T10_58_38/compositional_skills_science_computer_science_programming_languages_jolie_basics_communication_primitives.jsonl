This means that the control flow is not blocked, and the component can perform other tasks while it waits for a response (if one is expected).

The main difference lies in how they handle the communication between them.\n\nA synchronous operation is one where the component that sends a message waits for a response before continuing with its execution. This means that the control flow is blocked until a reply is received. For example, if Component A sends a request to Component B using a synchronous operation, then Component A will pause and wait for Component B to process the request and send back a response.\n\nOn the other hand, an asynchronous operation allows the component that sends a message to continue with its execution without waiting for a reply. This means that the control flow is not blocked, and the component can perform other tasks while it waits for a response (if one is expected). For example, if Component A sends a request to Component B using an asynchronous operation, then Component A will immediately receive a promise in return, which it can use to check later whether the response has arrived or not.","role":"assistant"}]}

The syntax for defining a solicit operation includes the `@` symbol followed by the outputPort name. For example: `operation_name@OutputPort_Name( request )( response )`.\n\nOn the other hand, a broadcast operation sends a message to all components that are listening on a specific channel without expecting a response. The syntax for defining a broadcast operation includes the `to` keyword followed by the channel name and the message to be sent.

Here's how to use it:\n\n1. Define the lambda expression for message filtering:\n\n```jolie\nlambda filter_message(msg: Message) returns bool {\n   \/\/ Your filtering logic here, e.g., checking message metadata\n   return msg.metadata.someKey == \"desiredValue\";\n}\n```\n\n2.

The component will only process messages that pass the filtering condition.","id":"f38f6b3b-3c73-45b7-9de4-f4a9fd499a27","messages":[{"content":"I am, Red Hat\u00ae Instruct Model based on Granite 7B, an AI language model developed by Red Hat and IBM Research, based on the Granite-7b-base language model.
