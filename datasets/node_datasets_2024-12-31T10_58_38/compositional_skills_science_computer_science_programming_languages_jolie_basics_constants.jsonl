However, they have some key differences:\n\nA global constant is defined at the top level of a Jolie file or module and can be accessed from any part of the program. It is declared using the following syntax:\n```\nconstants {\n    const_name = value\n}\n```\nFor example, if we define a global constant named \"PI\" with the value 3.14159265, it can be accessed from any function or module in our program as follows:\n```\nfunction main() {\n    print(PI * 2) \/\/ prints 6.283185307179586\n}\n```\n\nOn the other hand, a local constant is defined inside a function or module and can only be accessed from within that function or module. It is declared using the same syntax as global constants but inside the function or module definition. For example:\n```\nfunction square(x: int) returns int {\n    constants {\n        side_length = x\n    }\n    return side_length * side_length\n}\n\nprint(square(5)) \/\/ prints 25\n```\nIn this example, the constant \"side_length\" is only accessible within the \"square\" function and cannot be accessed from outside it.","role":"assistant"}]}

However, they serve different purposes:\n\nConstants are immutable values, meaning their value cannot be changed once it is defined. Constants are typically used for defining fixed values such as timeouts, error codes, or mathematical constants. They provide a way to ensure that the same value is used consistently throughout the program.\n\nGlobal variables, on the other hand, can be modified from any part of the program. Global variables are typically used for storing data that needs to be shared among different parts of the program. However, using global variables excessively can lead to code that is harder to understand and maintain.","role":"assistant"}]}
