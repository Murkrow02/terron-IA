How does Jolie support both?","role":"user"},{"content":"JSON-RPC (JavaScript Object Notation Remote Procedure Call) and SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) are two different protocols used for remote procedure call communication between applications over the internet.\n\nIn terms of message format, JSON-RPC uses a simple request-response message format with a JSON structure, while SOAP messages are more complex and use an XML format with additional headers and metadata. Here's a comparison:\n\nJSON-RPC:\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"method\": \"exampleMethod\",\n  \"params\": [1, \"hello\"],\n  \"id\": 1\n}\n```\n\nSOAP:\n```xml\n<soap:Envelope xmlns:soap=\"http:\/\/schemas.xmlsoap.org\/soap\/envelope\/\" xmlns:xsi=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2001\/XMLSchema-instance\" xmlns:xsd=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2001\/XMLSchema\">\n  <soap:Header\/>\n  <soap:Body>\n    <m:exampleMethod xmlns:m=\"namespace_uri\">\n      <param1 xsi:type=\"xsd:int\">1<\/param1>\n      <param2 xsi:type=\"xsd:string\">hello<\/param2>\n    <\/m:exampleMethod>\n  <\/soap:Body>\n<\/soap:Envelope>\n```\n\nAs for Jolie support, it can handle both JSON-RPC and SOAP requests. For JSON-RPC, you can define a service using the `jsonrpc` keyword, like this:\n\n```jolie\nimport stdlib;\nservice ExampleService {\n    jsonrpc service_entrypoint = {\n        int add(int x, int y) returns (int result) {\n            result = x + y;\n        }\n    };\n}\n```\n\nFor SOAP support, you need to use the `soap` library and define a WSDL file. Here's an example:\n\n```jolie\nimport stdlib;\nimport soap;\n\nservice ExampleService {\n    soap service_entrypoint = {\n        int add(int x, int y) returns (int result) {\n            result = x + y;\n        }\n    };\n}\n\ninterface ExampleServiceInterface {\n    int add(int x, int y);\n}\n\ndocument interface ExampleServiceWSDL {\n    import soap;\n\n    types {\n        int: xsd:int;\n    }\n\n    message addRequest {\n        part addParam {\n            element name=\"x\" type=\"int\";\n            element name=\"y\" type=\"int\";\n        }\n    }\n\n    message addResponse {\n        part result {\n            element name=\"result\" type=\"int\";\n        }\n    }\n\n    portType ExampleServicePortType {\n        operation add {\n            input message=\"addRequest\";\n            output message=\"addResponse\";\n        }\n    }\n\n    binding ExampleServiceBinding {\n        types {\n            soap:binding style=\"rpc\" transport=\"http:\/\/schemas.xmlsoap.org\/soap\/http\";\n        }\n\n        operation add {\n            soap:operation name=\"add\";\n            input message=\"addRequest\";\n            output message=\"addResponse\";\n        }\n    }\n}\n```","role":"assistant"}]}
