This approach allows for faster processing since all data is readily available in memory. However, it also requires sufficient memory to accommodate the size of the file.\n\nFor reading JSON files, Jolie provides functions like `jsonStreamFromFile@STREAM` and `jsonParse@Buffer`. The former reads JSON data from a file using streams, while the latter parses JSON data from a buffer.\n\nFor writing JSON files, Jolie offers functions such as `jsonStringToStream@STREAM` and `writeFile@File`.
