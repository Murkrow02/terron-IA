They are essential for ensuring robustness and reliability in service interactions.\n\nTo define a fault in Jolie, you use the keyword \"fault\" followed by the name of the fault and its optional attributes, such as a message and a cause. For instance:\n\n```jolie\ninterface MyService {\n  operation MyOperation() returns int {\n    \/\/ ... some code here\n     if (someCondition) then throw MyFault(\"Error message\") with cause = SomeCause;\n     \/\/ ... more code here\n  }\n\n  fault MyFault {\n    message: \"An error occurred\"\n    cause: SomeType;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWhen an operation encounters an error, it can throw a specific fault using the \"throw\" statement. The client can then handle this fault by defining a corresponding handler in their interface or code. For example:\n\n```jolie\ninterface MyClient {\n  operation CallMyService() returns int {\n    try {\n      result <- MyService::MyOperation();\n    } catch MyFault as f {\n      \/\/ handle the error here\n      println(\"An error occurred: \" + f.message);\n      if (f.cause instanceof SomeType) {\n        \/\/ process the cause here\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```","role":"assistant"}]}

These interfaces serve as a contract between a client and a server, specifying the available operations and their respective parameters. In Jolie, interfaces are composed of two main types: one-way and request-response.\n\nOne-way interfaces include operations where no response is expected from the service after processing a request. These operations can be useful for events or notifications, as they do not require any feedback from the server to complete their execution. For instance, an interface defining a weather service with a one-way operation might provide updates on current weather conditions without requiring a confirmation from the client.\n\nRequest-response interfaces, in contrast, define operations where a request is sent to the service, and a response is expected back. In this type of interface, the client sends a message to the server, and the server processes it before sending a reply. Request-response interfaces are commonly used when the client needs to receive specific information or have an interaction with a remote service. For example, a banking application might use a request-response interface for transactions: the user initiates a transfer request, and the server confirms the successful execution of the transaction with a response.\n\nIn Jolie, fault handling can be declared at various levels \u2013 interface, operation, or service level. When defining an interface, developers can specify which errors might occur during the execution of each operation.
