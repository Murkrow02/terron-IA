If the receiver's window is full, the sender will pause its transmission until it receives an acknowledgment for the data that has been sent. This ensures that the receiver can process the data at its own pace without being overwhelmed.\n\nAdditionally, BTL2CAP supports both reliable and unreliable data transfer modes. In reliable mode, the protocol guarantees that all data packets are delivered in order and without errors. In contrast, unreliable mode allows for faster transmission but does not guarantee packet delivery or order. The choice of mode depends on the specific application requirements and the capabilities of the devices involved.","role":"assistant"}]}

In BTL2CAP, connectionless data transfer is accomplished using the RFCOMM protocol encapsulated within L2CAP.\n\nWhen two devices want to exchange data without establishing a permanent connection, they use the Connectionless Request (CL_REQ) and Connectionless Response (CL_RSP) messages defined by the BTL2CAP profile. These messages are sent using the connectionless mode of operation in L2CAP, which allows for the transmission of individual data packets without requiring a reliable connection between the devices.\n\nThe sender initiates the transfer by sending a CL_REQ message to the receiver with the source and destination ports specified.

This service will handle encryption using the provided key storage:\n\n```jolie\nservice CustomBTL2CAPService(keyStorage: KeyStorage) {\n  private btl2cap: ServiceBTL2;\n\n  init() {\n    btl2cap = new ServiceBTL2(\"CustomBTL2CAPService\");\n    btl2cap.addProfile(new ProfileL2CAP_SAP);\n    btl2cap.addServiceRecord(new RecordServiceRecord(0x1001, \"CustomBTL2CAPService\"));\n  }\n\n  function handleConnectionRequest(request: ConnectionRequest) -> void {\n    let connection = new Connection(request);\n\n    connection.accept();\n\n    \/\/ Configure encryption using the provided key storage\n    btl2cap.configureSecurity(connection, true, keyStorage.getKey());\n\n    \/\/ Handle further communication with the connected device\n  }\n}\n```","role":"assistant"}]}

Two such features are flow control and error recovery.\n\nFlow control is a mechanism that manages the data transfer rate between devices to prevent data loss or congestion. In BTL2CAP, flow control is implemented using a sliding window protocol. The sender keeps track of the amount of data it has sent and the amount of space available in the receiver's buffer. Based on this information, the sender adjusts its transmission rate to avoid overflowing the receiver's buffer.\n\nError recovery is another important feature that ensures reliable data transfer between devices. BTL2CAP uses a selective repeat ARQ (Automatic Repeat reQuest) protocol for error recovery. When an error is detected in a packet, the receiver sends a negative acknowledgement (NAK) to the sender, requesting retransmission of the erroneous packet. The sender then retransmits the packet, and the process continues until all packets are successfully received by the receiver.","id":"990aa0e5-0d09-43ee-a510-5d85fbdb1faa","messages":[{"content":"I am, Red Hat\u00ae Instruct Model based on Granite 7B, an AI language model developed by Red Hat and IBM Research, based on the Granite-7b-base language model.

The `btl2cap_channel` type represents a connection to a remote device through the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocol's L2CAP layer.\n\nFirst, you need to establish multiple connections to the remote device using different channels. You can create a new channel by calling the `connectToDevice` function with the remote device address and the desired channel number. For example:\n\n```jolie\nchannel1 = btl2cap_channel(remoteAddress, 0x0100); \/\/ Channel 0x0100\nchannel2 = btl2cap_channel(remoteAddress, 0x0101); \/\/ Channel 0x0101\n```\n\nOnce you have established the channels, you can prioritize them by setting their priorities. The priority of a channel determines which channel will be used for data transfer when multiple channels are available. A higher priority value indicates a higher priority. You can set the priority using the `setPriority` function.

The `btl2cap_channel` type represents a connection to a remote device through the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocol's L2CAP layer.\n\nFirst, you need to establish multiple connections to the remote device using different channels. You can create a new channel by calling the `connectToDevice` function with the remote device address and the desired channel number. For example:\n\n```jolie\nchannel1 = btl2cap_channel(remoteAddress, 0x0100); \/\/ Channel 0x0100\nchannel2 = btl2cap_channel(remoteAddress, 0x0101); \/\/ Channel 0x0101\n```\n\nOnce you have established the channels, you can prioritize them by setting their priorities.

Authentication is used to verify the identity of communicating parties, while encryption ensures data confidentiality.\n\nFor authentication, BTL2CAP uses the L2CAP Security Manager (L2SM) protocol. The L2SM provides a framework for establishing secure connections between devices by exchanging security keys and negotiating security parameters.

Establish a connection between the client and server using the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocol.\n4. Once connected, the client sends an Service Discovery Protocol (SDP) request to the server to discover available services and their characteristics.\n5. The server responds with the SDP record containing the details of the service(s) it offers.\n6.
