Then, define a SOAPS input port and bind it to this interface. Configure the port with the necessary parameters such as location, wsdl, wsdl.port, ssl.keyStore, and sssl.keyStorePassword.\n\nNext, you need to configure the ESB to consume messages from Jolie. This involves creating a consumer in the ESB that listens for SOAP messages on a specific endpoint and forwards them to the appropriate service or process in Jolie. The configuration of this consumer depends on the specific ESB being used.\n\nFinally, you need to ensure that the security settings on both sides are properly configured to allow communication between Jolie and the ESB.
