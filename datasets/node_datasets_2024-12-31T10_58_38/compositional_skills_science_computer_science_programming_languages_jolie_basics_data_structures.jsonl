For each node, all simple paths from the node to descendant leaves contain the same number of black nodes.\n\nAVL Trees, on the other hand, use a more complex balancing strategy called \"height-balanced trees.\" AVL trees maintain a balance factor for each node that indicates the difference between the heights of its left and right subtrees. The tree is considered balanced if the balance factor for every node is -1, 0, or +1. When a node becomes unbalanced (balance factor > 1 or < -1), rotations are performed to restore balance.","role":"assistant"}]}

The basic syntax for using `sort()` is as follows:\n\n```jolie\narray sorted_array = array.sorted_copy(original_array, order)\n```\n\nHere, `original_array` is the input array that needs to be sorted, and `sorted_array` is the output array that will store the sorted elements. The `order` parameter specifies the sorting order. By default, it is set to `ascending`, which sorts the elements in ascending order. To sort in descending order, you can pass `descending` as the value of `order`.\n\nFor example, consider an array `numbers` containing integers that need to be sorted in ascending order:\n\n```jolie\nint numbers[] = [5, 2, 8, 1];\nint sorted_numbers[];\nsorted_numbers = numbers.sorted_copy(numbers, ascending);\nprint(sorted_numbers); \/\/ Output: [1, 2, 5, 8]\n```\n\nSimilarly, to sort the same array in descending order, you can modify the `order` parameter as follows:\n\n```jolie\nint numbers[] = [5, 2, 8, 1];\nint sorted_numbers[];\nsorted_numbers = numbers.sorted_copy(numbers, descending);\nprint(sorted_numbers); \/\/ Output: [8, 5, 2, 1]\n```","role":"assistant"}]}
