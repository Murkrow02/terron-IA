WSDL validation errors: These errors occur when the input WSDL document is not valid XML or does not conform to the WSDL 1.1 or WSDL 2.0 specification. To resolve this, ensure that the WSDL document is well-formed and validated using an XML validator before running wsdl2jolie.\n2. Mismatched types: This error occurs when the data types in the WSDL document do not match those expected by Jolie. For example, if a message contains an element with type xsd:int but the generated Jolie interface defines it as xsd:string, this error will occur. To resolve this, ensure that the data types in the WSDL document and the generated Jolie interface match.\n3. Missing or incorrect bindings: This error occurs when the generated Jolie interface does not contain the necessary bindings for the operations defined in the WSDL document. To resolve this, ensure that all bindings are correctly defined in the WSDL document and that they are properly mapped to the corresponding Jolie interfaces.\n4. Missing or incorrect imports: This error occurs when the generated Jolie interface does not import the necessary namespaces or types from external schemas referenced in the WSDL document. To resolve this, ensure that all necessary imports are correctly defined in the generated Jolie interface.\n5. Incorrect handling of complex types: This error occurs when wsdl2jolie fails to correctly generate Jolie interfaces for complex types defined in the WSDL document.

When an unexpected error occurs during the interaction, the corresponding exception is thrown and can be handled by defining a handler for that exception.\n\nFirst, let's identify the exceptions that can be thrown based on the WSDL document. You can find this information in the WSDL file under the \"fault\" element within the \"message\" element of each operation. For example:\n\n```xml\n<operation name=\"exampleOperation\">\n  <input message=\"tns:ExampleRequestMessage\"\/>\n  <output message=\"tns:ExampleResponseMessage\"\/>\n  <fault name=\"ExampleFault\" message=\"tns:ExampleFaultMessage\"\/>\n<\/operation>\n```\n\nIn the example above, \"ExampleFault\" is the name of the exception that can be thrown during this operation.\n\nNext, define a handler for the identified exceptions in your Jolie code. Here's an example of how to handle the \"ExampleFault\":\n\n```jolie\ninterface ExampleWebService {\n  \/\/ ... other interface definitions\n\n  exception ExampleFault as { message : String };\n\n  operation handleException() returns void {\n    try {\n      \/\/ Call the Web Service operation here\n      let result = exampleOperation();\n    } catch (ex: Exception) {\n      if (ex is ExampleFault) {\n        info \"An ExampleFault occurred: \" + ex.message;\n      } else {\n        error \"Unexpected exception: \" + ex.getMessage();\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn the example above, we define an `ExampleFault` exception and a handler for it named `handleException`. When an `ExampleFault` is thrown during the interaction, the message associated with the fault will be logged. If any other exception occurs, an error message will be logged instead.","id":"f0aa9672-8f19-46a9-a8f8-128bf363672c","messages":[{"content":"I am, Red Hat\u00ae Instruct Model based on Granite 7B, an AI language model developed by Red Hat and IBM Research, based on the Granite-7b-base language model.

When an unexpected error occurs during the interaction, the corresponding exception is thrown and can be handled by defining a handler for that exception.\n\nFirst, let's identify the exceptions that can be thrown based on the WSDL document. You can find this information in the WSDL file under the \"fault\" element within the \"message\" element of each operation. For example:\n\n```xml\n<operation name=\"exampleOperation\">\n  <input message=\"tns:ExampleRequestMessage\"\/>\n  <output message=\"tns:ExampleResponseMessage\"\/>\n  <fault name=\"ExampleFault\" message=\"tns:ExampleFaultMessage\"\/>\n<\/operation>\n```\n\nIn the example above, \"ExampleFault\" is the name of the exception that can be thrown during this operation.\n\nNext, define a handler for the identified exceptions in your Jolie code. Here's an example of how to handle the \"ExampleFault\":\n\n```jolie\ninterface ExampleWebService {\n  \/\/ ... other interface definitions\n\n  exception ExampleFault as { message : String };\n\n  operation handleException() returns void {\n    try {\n      \/\/ Call the Web Service operation here\n      let result = exampleOperation();\n    } catch (ex: Exception) {\n      if (ex is ExampleFault) {\n        info \"An ExampleFault occurred: \" + ex.message;\n      } else {\n        error \"Unexpected exception: \" + ex.getMessage();\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn the example above, we define an `ExampleFault` exception and a handler for it named `handleException`. When an `ExampleFault` is thrown during the interaction, the message associated with the fault will be logged. If any other exception occurs, an error message will be logged instead.","role":"assistant"}]}

For example:\n\n```java\ncomponent InterfaceName_Impl extends InterfaceName_Impl {\n  property MyCustomFaultHandler: MyCustomFaultHandler = new MyCustomFaultHandler();\n}\n```\n\n3. Configure the WSDL document to use your custom fault handler by adding a `<handler>` element in the appropriate place in the WSDL file. For example, for a SOAP interface, you might add it under the binding for a specific operation:\n\n```xml\n<binding name=\"BindingName\" type=\"tns:InterfaceType\">\n  <soap:binding style=\"document\" transport=\"http:\/\/schemas.xmlsoap.org\/soap\/http\"\/>\n  <operation name=\"OperationName\">\n    <soap:operation soapAction=\"...\"\/>\n    <input message=\"...\"\/>\n    <output message=\"...\"\/>\n    <fault name=\"FaultName\">\n      <handler class=\"com.yourpackage.MyCustomFaultHandler\"\/>\n    <\/fault>\n  <\/operation>\n<\/binding>\n```\n\n4. Compile the Jolie code using wsdl2jolie as usual, and your custom fault handler should be integrated into the generated interface.","role":"assistant"}]}

When a client sends a request to an asynchronous Web Service, the Jolie runtime generates an event representing the incoming message. The service can then process this event and send a response back to the client through the event system. This mechanism enables non-blocking communication between clients and services, allowing for more efficient handling of multiple requests.","role":"assistant"}]}
