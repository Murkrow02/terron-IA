One of its key features is the rich support for various data types. In Jolie, data can be classified into three main categories: basic, refined, and custom data types.\n\nBasic data types include integers, floating-point numbers, strings, booleans, arrays, and structures. These are simple, atomic data types that form the building blocks for more complex data constructs. For instance, an integer can represent the number of items in a shopping cart, whereas a string can store customer names or product descriptions.\n\nRefined data types extend basic data types by providing additional functionality or structure. They include enumerations, sets, and sequences. Enumerations define a finite set of named values, such as the days of the week or colors. Sets represent unordered collections of unique elements, while sequences are ordered lists with specific access and modification functions.\n\nCustom data types allow users to define their own complex structures tailored to their application domain. These can be defined using classes, interfaces, and abstract data types. Classes provide a blueprint for creating new objects and defining their behavior, while interfaces specify a contract that objects must adhere to. Abstract data types hide the internal structure of complex data, allowing users to interact with it through well-defined operations.\n\nWhat are the advantages of using refined data types, such as sets or sequences, instead of basic data types in Jolie?

Jolie offers various data types to cater to different requirements. Let's explore some basic, refined, and custom data types in this context.\n\nA basic data type is the simplest form of data representation in Jolie. It includes integer (int), real number (float), boolean (bool), string (str), and character (char). For example:\n\ntype SimpleData {\n    myNumber: int = 5;\n    myFloat: float = 3.14;\n    myBoolean: bool = true;\n    myString: str = \"Hello, World!\";\n    myChar: char = 'A';\n}\n\nRefined data types enable defining complex structures and composing multiple basic data types within a single type definition. This can be done using the keyword \"ref\" followed by the name of the base data type. For instance, arrays (int[]) and maps (map<string, int>) are refined data types. Here's an example:\n\ntype ShoppingList {\n    items: map<string, int> = {\n        bananas: 3,\n        apples: 5,\n        oranges: 2\n    };\n}\n\nLastly, custom data types allow users to create their own, more intricate data structures. This is achieved by defining a new type with the keyword \"type\" followed by the desired name and then listing the fields and their corresponding data types.
