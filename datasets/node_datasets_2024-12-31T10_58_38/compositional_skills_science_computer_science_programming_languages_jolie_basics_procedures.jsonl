For example, `sumProcedure` is called in the `main` procedure in the example above.\n","question":"What is the difference between a procedure and a function call in Jolie?","response":"In Jolie, both procedures and functions are used to define a block of code that can be called multiple times. However, there is a key difference between them: a procedure call does not return a value, while a function call returns a value.\n\nA procedure is defined using the keyword `proc`, and its main purpose is to perform an action or modify the state of the system. For example, a procedure might be used to send a message or update a variable. Procedures do not return a value, so they are typically called using the call operator `()`.\n\nA function, on the other hand, is defined using the keyword `fun`, and its main purpose is to compute a result based on some input. Functions always return a value, which can be of any type. For example, a function might be used to calculate the square root of a number or find the length of a string.

The procedure will only be executed if the given condition is true. Here's an example:\n\n```jolie\nprocedure ExampleProcedure(inputParam : Int) returns (outputParam : Int) {\n  when (inputParam > 10) then {\n    outputParam = inputParam * 2;\n  } else {\n    error \"Input parameter must be greater than 10.\";\n  };\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `ExampleProcedure` procedure takes an integer as its input parameter and returns another integer as its output. The guard condition checks if the input parameter is greater than 10. If it is, then the procedure multiplies the input by 2 and assigns the result to the output parameter. If not, an error message is generated.","role":"assistant"}]}
