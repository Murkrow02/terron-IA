It can be used to create, manipulate, and compare time objects. Here's an example:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import time\n\n# Creating a Time object\nt = time(14, 30, 0) # 2:30 PM\nprint(\"Time object:\", t)\n\n# Adding minutes to a Time object\nnew_time = t + timedelta(minutes=30) # 2 hours and 30 minutes after 2:30 PM\nprint(\"New time object:\", new_time)\n```\n\nOn the other hand, the `datetime` module is used for handling both date and time components. It can be used to create, manipulate, compare, and format datetime objects. Here's an example:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\n# Creating a datetime object\ndt = datetime(2023, 3, 15, 14, 30) # March 15, 2023 at 2:30 PM\nprint(\"Datetime object:\", dt)\n\n# Adding days to a datetime object\nnew_datetime = dt + timedelta(days=7) # March 22, 2023 at 2:30 PM (7 days after March 15, 2023)\nprint(\"New datetime object:\", new_datetime)\n```","role":"assistant"}]}
