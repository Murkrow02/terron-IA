Here's an explanation of both methods:\n\n1. Coroutines: A coroutine is a function that can be suspended and resumed at specific points during its execution. In Jolie, you can define a coroutine by prefixing the function name with the keyword `co`. When a coroutine is called, it returns a handle which can be used to resume or suspend it. Here's an example of how to implement a concurrent addition using coroutines:\n\n```jolie\nservice CalculatorService {\n  operation add(a: int, b: int): int = co {\n    let result = a + b;\n    yield; \/\/ Suspend the coroutine and return control to the caller\n    return result;\n  }\n\n  outputPort AddPort {\n    oneway operation requestAddition(a: int, b: int) {\n      let handle = add(a, b);\n      send result to client using AddPort;\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n2. Asynchronous calls: Another way to implement concurrency in Jolie is by making asynchronous calls between services. This can be done using the `async` keyword when calling an operation. The caller service will continue executing while the called operation is being processed. Here's an example of how to implement a concurrent addition using asynchronous calls:\n\n```jolie\nservice CalculatorService {\n  outputPort AddPort {\n    oneway operation requestAddition(a: int, b: int) = {\n      let result = async add(a, b);\n      send result to client using AddPort;\n    }\n\n    oneway operation receiveResult(result: int) {\n      \/\/ Handle the result here\n    }\n  }\n\n  operation add(a: int, b: int): int = {\n    let sum = a + b;\n    return sum;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, when `requestAddition` is called, it sends the request to the `add` operation asynchronously and continues executing.

Here's an example of how to define such behavior:\n\n```jolie\ninterface CalculatorService {\n  operation add(in int a, in int b : out int sum) {\n    sum = a + b;\n  }\n\n  operation subtract(in int a, in int b : out int difference) {\n    difference = a - b;\n  }\n\n  behavior CalculatorBehavior {\n    var queue: queue<request> = [];\n\n    on new RequestAdd(a: int, b: int) -> AddRequest {\n      sum <- add(a, b);\n      queue.pop();\n    }\n\n    on new RequestSubtract(a: int, b: int) -> SubtractRequest {\n      difference <- subtract(a, b);\n      queue.pop();\n    }\n\n    on new Request(req: request) when isEmpty(queue) {\n      switch req {\n        case AddRequest(a, b) => add(a, b);\n        case SubtractRequest(a, b) => subtract(a, b);\n        default => error \"Invalid request\";\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `CalculatorBehavior` handles concurrent requests by maintaining a queue of incoming requests and processing them one at a time.
