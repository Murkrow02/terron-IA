You can use tools like `netstat` or `lsof` to identify any conflicting processes.\n\n3. Firewall Rules: Firewalls may block SODEPS traffic, preventing communication between services. To address this issue, ensure that the firewall rules allow traffic on the specified SODEPS ports. You can consult your network administrator for assistance with configuring firewall rules.\n\n4. Network Connectivity: Poor network connectivity or intermittent internet connections can cause issues when configuring SODEPS ports. To overcome this, ensure that both the client and server have stable network connections. If necessary, consider using a VPN or other secure connection methods to improve network reliability.","role":"assistant"}]}
