The `getIPAddresses` operation does not have a direct parameter for this, but you can achieve it by querying the DHCP server for all addresses within the desired subnet and then filtering the result in your application logic.\n\nFirst, use the `queryFilter` parameter to search for IP addresses that fall within the given subnet mask. For example, if you want to find all IP addresses with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 (\/24), you can set the query filter as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"queryFilter\": {\n    \"expression\": {\n      \"and\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"subnet\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"<your_subnet>\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"ipAddress\",\n          \"operator\": \"bitwiseAnd\",\n          \"value\": {\n            \"mask\": 255255255,\n            \"shift\": 0\n          }\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\nReplace `<your_subnet>` with the subnet you are interested in.
