To implement a circular buffer in Jolie, you can create your own custom data structure using an array and some additional logic.\n\nHere's a simple example of how to create a circular buffer with a fixed size (`bufferSize`) in Jolie:\n\n```jolie\ninterface CircularBuffer {\n  int bufferSize;\n  int currentIndex = 0;\n  int headIndex = 0;\n  int tailIndex = 0;\n  int[] buffer;\n\n  operation initialize(int _bufferSize) {\n    bufferSize = _bufferSize;\n    buffer = new int[bufferSize];\n  }\n\n  operation push(int value) {\n    if (isFull()) {\n      throw new Error(\"Buffer is full.\");\n    }\n\n    buffer[headIndex] = value;\n    headIndex = (headIndex + 1) % bufferSize;\n    tailIndex = (tailIndex + 1) % bufferSize;\n  }\n\n  operation pop() {\n    if (isEmpty()) {\n      throw new Error(\"Buffer is empty.\");\n    }\n\n    int value = buffer[tailIndex];\n    tailIndex = (tailIndex + 1) % bufferSize;\n\n    return value;\n  }\n\n  operation peek() {\n    if (isEmpty()) {\n      throw new Error(\"Buffer is empty.\");\n    }\n\n    return buffer[headIndex];\n  }\n\n  operation isEmpty() = (tailIndex == headIndex);\n\n  operation isFull() = ((headIndex + 1) % bufferSize == tailIndex);\n}\n```\n\nThis example uses an array to store the data and some additional variables to keep track of the head index, tail index, and buffer size. The `push`, `pop`, `peek`, `isEmpty`, and `isFull` operations are provided for adding, removing, checking the head value, and determining if the buffer is empty or full, respectively.","role":"assistant"}]}
