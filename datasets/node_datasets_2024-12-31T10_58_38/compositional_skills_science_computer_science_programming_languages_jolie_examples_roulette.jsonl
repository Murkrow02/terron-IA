For example:\n```\ncomponent A {\n    inputPort ReceiverPort { ... }\n    outputPort SenderPort { ... }\n    \/\/ Static binding: ReceiverPort is always connected to component B's SenderPort\n    connect ReceiverPort -> B.SenderPort\n}\n\ncomponent B {\n    inputPort SenderPort { ... }\n    outputPort ReceiverPort { ... }\n    \/\/ Static binding: SenderPort is always connected to component A's ReceiverPort\n    connect SenderPort <- A.ReceiverPort\n}\n```\n\nDynamic binding, on the other hand, allows components to discover each other at runtime and establish communication dynamically.

It places the bet using the `placeBet` function and waits for the roulette wheel to spin using the `spinWheel` function with the help of the `Promise::all` construct.

Instead, it's typically assumed that the roulette wheel is an external component or pre-existing infrastructure. The TableService interacts with the roulette wheel through input and output ports defined by the interface `RouletteWheelToTableServiceInterface`.

The Croupier is designed to only accept bets before spinning the roulette wheel.

When a new Player joins the game by sending a `JoinTable` message to the TableService, it creates a new Player instance and adds it to the data structure.\n\nWhen a Player places a bet using the `PlaceBet` message, the TableService checks if there is an existing Player with the same PlayerID.
