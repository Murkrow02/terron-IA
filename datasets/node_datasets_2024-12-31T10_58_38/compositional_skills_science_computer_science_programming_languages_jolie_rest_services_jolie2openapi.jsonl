Here are some popular options:\n\n1. **OpenAPI Generator:** This is a multi-language open-source generation toolkit that supports various programming languages, including JOLIE. It can generate server stubs, client SDKs, and API documentation from an existing OpenAPI specification or from annotated source code. Compared to `jolie2openapi`, it offers more extensive functionality, such as generating client libraries for multiple platforms and integrating with popular frameworks like Spring Boot and Express.js.\n\n2. **Swagger Codegen:** Swagger Codegen is another open-source tool that can generate server stubs, client SDKs, and API documentation from an OpenAPI specification or annotated source code. It supports various programming languages, including JOLIE. Swagger Codegen's main advantage over `jolie2openapi` is its ability to generate client libraries for multiple platforms and frameworks, making it a more versatile choice for larger projects.\n\n3. **Apache Cyanide:** Apache Cyanide is an open-source tool that generates OpenAPI specifications from WSDL or XSD files. It can also be used with JOLIE by converting the JOLIE interface to WSDL and then using Apache Cyanide to generate the OpenAPI specification. Compared to `jolie2openapi`, it offers more extensive support for complex data types, making it a better choice when dealing with large and intricate schemas.","id":"e5469253-4ecc-48d4-a724-148d20e6e6fc","messages":[{"content":"I am, Red Hat\u00ae Instruct Model based on Granite 7B, an AI language model developed by Red Hat and IBM Research, based on the Granite-7b-base language model.
