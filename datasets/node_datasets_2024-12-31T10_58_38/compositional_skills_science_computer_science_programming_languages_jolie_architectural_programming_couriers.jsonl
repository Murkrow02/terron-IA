However, I must clarify that creating a complete and functional courier system is beyond the scope of this response due to its complexity. Instead, I can provide you with a basic example of how to define a simple sender and receiver interaction in Jolie.\n\nFirst, let's define a message type:\n\n```jolie\ndata Message = Request(int id) | Response(int id, int result)\n```\n\nNow, we can define the sender process:\n\n```jolie\nprocess Sender() {\n    var id : int\n    while true {\n        id <- getNextID()\n        send Receiver!Request(id)\n        receive Receiver!Response(_, result) -> println(\"Received result:\", result)\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAnd the receiver process:\n\n```jolie\nprocess Receiver() {\n    while true {\n        let req = receive Sender!Request(id)\n        send Sender!Response(id, calculateResult(id))\n    }\n}\n\nfunction getNextID() : int = 0\nfunction calculateResult(id : int) : int = id * 2\n```\n\nThis example demonstrates a simple sender-receiver interaction where the sender generates requests and the receiver processes them, returning the result back to the sender. The `getNextID` function generates unique IDs for each request, and the `calculateResult` function calculates the result based on the given ID.\n\nKeep in mind that this example is quite basic and doesn't include error handling or other important aspects of a real-world courier system.

This interface should include all the operations that the consumers can invoke on the service. For example:\n\n```jolie\ninterface ConsumerInterface {\n  operation Operation1(arg1: Int) returns (result: String);\n  operation Operation2(arg2: String) returns (result: Int);\n}\n```\n\nNext, create a courier service that manages the communication between the consumers and your main service. The courier service will handle the routing of requests from consumers to the main service and responses back to the consumers. Here's an example of how you can define such a courier:\n\n```jolie\nservice Courier {\n  interface ConsumerInterface;\n\n  var consumers: Map<String, Channel> = [];\n\n  operation registerConsumer(consumerID: String, consumerChannel: Channel) {\n    consumers[consumerID] = consumerChannel;\n  }\n\n  operation handleRequest(request: RequestMessage) -> ResponseMessage {\n    let operationName = request.operation;\n    let args = request.args;\n    let consumer = consumers[operationName];\n\n    if (consumer != null) {\n      consumer ! request;\n      let response = receive response: ResponseMessage from consumer;\n      return response;\n    } else {\n      error \"No consumer found for operation: \" + operationName;\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nFinally, create your main service that interacts with the courier to handle requests and responses. The main service should not communicate directly with consumers but only through the courier. Here's an example of how you can define such a main service:\n\n```jolie\nservice MainService {\n  interface ConsumerInterface;\n  var courier: Channel = new Channel();\n\n  operation handleRequest(request: RequestMessage) -> ResponseMessage {\n    courier ? handleRequest(request);\n    let response = receive response: ResponseMessage from courier;\n    return response;\n  }\n\n  operation handleRequest(request: RequestMessage) {\n    \/\/ Your main service logic here\n    let result = \"Result of your main service\";\n    let response = new ResponseMessage(result);\n    send response to courier;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNow, you can create instances of the `Courier`, `MainService`, and register consumers with the courier.

Here's an outline of how to achieve this:\n\n1. Retry Mechanisms: Implementing retry mechanisms allows the courier to automatically resend messages if they fail during transmission. You can use Jolie's built-in `retry` statement for this purpose. For example, you can wrap a send operation inside a loop with a delay between retries.\n\n```jolie\nservice Courier {\n  on receive(request: Request) {\n    let response = sendRequest(request); \/\/ Send the request to the target service\n    if (response is Fault) { \/\/ If the response indicates an error\n      after 1s { \/\/ Wait for a second before retrying\n        let new_request = createNewRequest(); \/\/ Create a new request\n        let result = sendRequest(new_request); \/\/ Retry sending the request\n        if (result is Fault) { \/\/ If the retry also fails\n          handleError(request, \"Retry limit exceeded\");\n        } else { \/\/ If the retry succeeds\n          handleSuccess(request, result);\n        }\n      }\n    } else { \/\/ If the response is successful\n      handleSuccess(request, response);\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n2. Error Handling: Proper error handling is crucial for fault tolerance. In Jolie, you can use the `handleError` statement to define custom error handlers that process errors and provide alternative actions. For instance, you can log the error, notify an administrator, or retry the operation.\n\n```jolie\nservice Courier {\n  on receive(request: Request) {\n    let response = sendRequest(request); \/\/ Send the request to the target service\n    if (response is Fault) { \/\/ If the response indicates an error\n      handleError(request, \"An error occurred while processing your request\");\n    } else { \/\/ If the response is successful\n      handleSuccess(request, response);\n    }\n  }\n\n  on error(error: Error, request: Request) {\n    logError(error, request); \/\/ Log the error for further analysis\n    let new_request = createNewRequest(); \/\/ Create a new request\n    let result = sendRequest(new_request); \/\/ Retry sending the request\n    if (result is Fault) { \/\/ If the retry also fails\n      handleError(request, \"Retry limit exceeded\");\n    } else { \/\/ If the retry succeeds\n      handleSuccess(request, result);\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n3.

For example:\n\n```jolie\ntype Message = {\n  source : String,\n  destination : String,\n  content : Map\n}\n```\n\n2. Define your courier service: Next, define your courier service with a port for receiving messages and a function for processing them based on their content. For example:\n\n```jolie\nservice Courier {\n  ports: {\n    in : {\n      oneway : Message\n    }\n  }\n\n  functions: {\n    processMessage : (msg : Message) -> void = {\n      switch msg.content[\"type\"] {\n        \"email\" => forwardToEmailServer(msg),\n        \"sms\" => forwardToSMSGateway(msg),\n        _ => log(\"Unknown message type\")\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n3. Implement content-based routing: In the `processMessage` function, use a switch statement to check the message's content and forward it to the appropriate destination based on its type. For example, you might forward emails to an email server and SMS messages to an SMS gateway.\n\n4. Define your forwarding functions: Finally, define functions for forwarding messages to their respective destinations. These functions can use Jolie's built-in `send` statement or external APIs to send the message on its way. For example:\n\n```jolie\nfunction forwardToEmailServer(msg : Message) = {\n  let emailService = \"email.example.com\"\n  send emailService {\n    to : msg.destination,\n    subject : msg.content[\"subject\"],\n    body : msg.content[\"body\"]\n  }\n}\n\nfunction forwardToSMSGateway(msg : Message) = {\n  let smsGateway = \"sms.example.com\"\n  send smsGateway {\n    to : msg.destination,\n    message : msg.content[\"message\"]\n  }\n}\n```","role":"assistant"}]}
