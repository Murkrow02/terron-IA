Create an instance of `BufferedReader` by wrapping the standard input stream with an `InputStreamReader`: `BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));`\n3.

This approach allows your program to process smaller portions of the input without encountering an error due to the input size limit. Here's a general idea of how this could be done:\n\n1.

In the console library, arrays and lists can be handled similarly for reading and writing operations. Here's a brief explanation:\n\nTo read an array or list from the console, you first need to declare the variable with its type and size, then use a loop to read each element one by one. For example, if we have an integer array of size 5 named `numbers`, we can read its elements as follows:\n\n```java\nint[] numbers = new int[5];\nfor (int i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {\n    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n    System.out.print(\"Enter element number \" + (i+1) + \": \");\n    numbers[i] = scanner.nextInt();\n}\n```\n\nTo write an array or list to the console, you can use a loop to print each element separated by a delimiter, such as a space or a comma. For instance, if we have the same `numbers` array from above, we can print its elements as follows:\n\n```java\nSystem.out.print(\"Elements of the array: \");\nfor (int number : numbers) {\n    System.out.print(number + \" \");\n}\nSystem.out.println();\n```\n\nFor lists, you would use a List interface, such as `ArrayList`, and replace the `numbers[i]` with `numbers.set(i, value)` for writing and `numbers.get(i)` for reading.

Here's a simple explanation of how to use them:\n\n1. Output Redirection: By default, when you run a command in the terminal, its output is displayed on the screen. However, you can redirect the output to a file using the `>` symbol followed by the filename. For example:\n```bash\n$ ls > list.txt\n```\nThis command will list all files and directories in the current directory and save the output to a file named `list.txt`. If the file already exists, its content will be overwritten. To append the output instead of overwriting it, use the `>>` symbol:\n```bash\n$ ls >> list.txt\n```\n2. Input Redirection: By default, when you run a command in the terminal, it reads input from the keyboard. However, you can redirect the input from a file using the `<` symbol followed by the filename. For example:\n```bash\n$ cat < input.txt\n```\nThis command will read the contents of the `input.txt` file and display them on the screen when you run it.\n3. Pipes: You can use pipes to pass the output of one command as the input of another command. For example, to list all files in a directory and print their sizes in human-readable format, you can use the following command:\n```bash\n$ ls -lh | grep \"^-\" | awk '{print $5}'\n```\nThis command uses three commands (`ls`, `grep`, and `awk`) connected by pipes. The output of `ls -lh` is passed as input to `grep`, which filters out the lines that don't start with a hyphen (indicating directories), and then the filtered output is passed as input to `awk`, which prints only the fifth column (file size).","id":"c118ff80-2483-4e2b-bdd1-ab6e396ac8f0","messages":[{"content":"I am, Red Hat\u00ae Instruct Model based on Granite 7B, an AI language model developed by Red Hat and IBM Research, based on the Granite-7b-base language model.
