In Jolie, you can handle webhooks using the `Link` header in an HTTP response.\n\nTo create a webhook in Jolie, first define a procedure that will be called when the webhook is triggered. This procedure should accept an HTTP request and return an appropriate response. For example:\n\n```jolie\nprocedure handleWebhook(request: HTTPRequest) returns (HTTPResponse) {\n  \/\/ process the request and generate a response\n}\n```\n\nNext, define a service that listens for incoming webhooks and calls the `handleWebhook` procedure when a request is received. This can be done using Jolie's built-in HTTP server:\n\n```jolie\nservice MyService {\n  listen on port 8080;\n\n  procedure handleRequest() {\n    let response = HTTPResponse();\n    let linkHeader = \"Link: <http:\/\/localhost:8080\/webhook>; rel=\\\"webhook\\\"; method=\\\"POST\\\"\";\n    response.statusCode = 200;\n    response.headers[\"Content-Type\"] = \"application\/json\";\n    response.headers[\"Link\"] = linkHeader;\n    send response to client;\n\n    let body = parseJSON(request.body);\n    handleWebhook(body);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn the example above, the `handleRequest` procedure sets the `Link` header in the HTTP response with a URL pointing back to the same endpoint (`\/webhook`) and the `POST` method. This allows the client to send future webhook notifications to this endpoint by making a `POST` request to it.\n\nWhen the server receives a `POST` request to the `\/webhook` endpoint, it will call the `handleWebhook` procedure with the request body as an argument.","id":"5bc0e81f-5dda-4ba8-b6b2-9c1e954f4575","messages":[{"content":"I am, Red Hat\u00ae Instruct Model based on Granite 7B, an AI language model developed by Red Hat and IBM Research, based on the Granite-7b-base language model.
