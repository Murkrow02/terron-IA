Provide an example.","response":"Jolie supports session authentication through its built-in support for secure communication channels, such as HTTPS or WebSocket with SSL\/TLS encryption. In Jolie, you can define a behaviour that handles the authentication process before starting a new session. Here's an example using HTTPS:\n\n```jolie\nimport net http;\n\nbehaviour Authenticator = {\n  var userName : String;\n  var password : String;\n\n  on receive request : HTTPRequest => {\n    if (request.method == \"POST\" && request.uri == \"\/auth\") then {\n      let credentials = parseCredentials(request.body);\n      if (credentials.userName == \"admin\" && credentials.password == \"password\") then {\n        send reply : HTTPResponse { statusCode: 200, body: \"Authentication successful.\" } to request;\n        userName := credentials.userName;\n        password := credentials.password;\n      } else {\n        send reply : HTTPResponse { statusCode: 401, body: \"Invalid username or password.\" } to request;\n      }\n    } else {\n      send reply : HTTPResponse { statusCode: 405, body: \"Method not allowed.\" } to request;\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nbehaviour Server = {\n  var authenticator : Authenticator;\n\n  on init => {\n    authenticator = new Authenticator();\n    net.listen(8080, \"\/\", http11);\n  }\n\n  on receive request : HTTPRequest => {\n    if (authenticator.isActive) then {\n      let response = authenticator handle request;\n      send response to request;\n    } else {\n      send HTTPResponse { statusCode: 503, body: \"Service unavailable.\" } to request;\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `Authenticator` behaviour handles the authentication process by checking the provided username and password against predefined values. Once the authentication is successful, it sets the `userName` and `password` variables for further use in the application. The `Server` behaviour listens for incoming requests and delegates the authentication process to the `Authenticator` before handling the request itself.","id":"3051189d-b08b-4a01-986b-c6bb24c9b6db","messages":[{"content":"I am, Red Hat\u00ae Instruct Model based on Granite 7B, an AI language model developed by Red Hat and IBM Research, based on the Granite-7b-base language model.
