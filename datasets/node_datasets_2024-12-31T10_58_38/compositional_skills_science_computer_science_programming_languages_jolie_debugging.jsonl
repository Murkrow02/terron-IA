Analyze the visualization provided by the Jolie Trace Viewer. The tool offers various views, such as the process view, the event view, and the message view. These views help you understand the program flow, identify bottlenecks, and trace the execution of individual processes.\n4. Use filters to narrow down your search for complex issues. For instance, you can filter events by their type or by specific process names. This will help you focus on the relevant parts of the trace.\n5. Export the visualization as an image or a report if needed. Jolie Trace Viewer allows you to save the current view as an image file or generate a detailed report in HTML format. These exports can be shared with team members for further analysis and discussion.","role":"assistant"}]}

Here are a few:\n\n1. Overhead: Tracing generates a lot of output, which can slow down the execution of your program significantly. This may not be an issue for small or simple programs, but it can become a problem for larger and more complex ones.\n2. Limited visibility into internal states: While tracing provides detailed information about the sequence of events in a program, it does not give you direct insight into the internal states of variables or data structures. For that, you may need to use other debugging techniques such as breakpoints or assertions.\n3. Complexity of output: The amount and complexity of the tracing output can make it difficult to identify the root cause of a problem. You may need to use tools like log parsing or visualization software to help make sense of the data.\n4.

For instance, run your program with the following command: `jolie --trace myProgram.ol`.\n\n2. After executing the program with tracing enabled, a trace file will be generated in the same directory as your Jolie source code. The name of the trace file will be `<your_program_name>.trc`.\n\n3. Now you can use the Jolie Trace Viewer to visualize and analyze the generated trace data. To open the trace file with the viewer, run the following command: `jolietraceview myProgram.trc`. This will launch the Jolie Trace Viewer application, where you can explore the call stack, function execution order, and other details related to your program's behavior.\n\n4. In the Jolie Trace Viewer, you can navigate through the trace data to inspect the recursive function calls.
