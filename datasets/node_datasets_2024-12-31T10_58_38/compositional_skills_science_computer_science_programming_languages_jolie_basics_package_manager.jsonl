Cache dependencies: JPM caches downloaded dependencies locally to speed up subsequent builds. Make sure you have enough disk space available for the cache directory. You can check its location by running `jpm config get cache.local`.\n\n3. Use a proxy server: If your network has a proxy server, configure JPM to use it by setting the environment variable `JPM_PROXY` or adding the following line in your `jolie.conf` file:\n```javascript\n{ \"jpm\": { \"proxy\": \"<your-proxy-url>\" } }\n```\nReplace `<your-proxy-url>` with the URL of your proxy server.\n\n4.

You can configure the location of this repository using the `--offline` flag or by setting the `JAVA_HOME\/m2` or `~\/.npm` environment variables.\n\n2. **Dependency resolution**: JPM uses a dependency resolution algorithm that ensures all dependencies are installed in the correct order, minimizing conflicts and redundancies.

This can help prevent issues caused by dependency version conflicts and improve build reproducibility.\n\n4. **Concurrency**: JPM supports parallel downloads and installations, which can significantly reduce the time it takes to install dependencies.

These dependencies are installed once and then used across multiple projects without requiring an internet connection.\n\nRemote dependencies, on the other hand, are libraries that are hosted online, typically on public repositories such as GitHub or NPM. When using remote dependencies in a Jolie project, they need to be downloaded and installed each time the project is built or when the dependency version is updated.
